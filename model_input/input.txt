STAR FOUND BY STARDRIFTER FRACTUS, EPOC 6011:573.426.
THIS SYSTEM HAS 8 STARS! I WILL COMMENCE EXPLORATION OF PLANETS
IMMEDIATELY!
I'VE STARTED TO SCOUT OUT THE PLANETS. KAHDEON BETA APPARENTLY
HAS NO PLANETS ORBITING IT.
I'VE ALSO SCOUTE THE KAHDEON DELTA SYSTEM, IT HAD EIGHT PLANETS,
BUT NONE OF THEM ARE VERY INTERESTING. TWO SUBSTELLAR OBJECTS,
THOUGH. (NOTES BY STARDRIFTER FRACTUS, EPOC 6011:573.559)
KAHDEON GAMMA HAS ONE PLANET THAT HAS A THICK ATHMOSPHERE.
I NAMED IT THREON. THE SURFACE FEATURES SEEMED UNREMARKABLE, BUT
MY INVESTIGATION WAS NOT DONE VERY THOROUGHLY.
(NOTES BY STARDRIFTER FRACTUS, EPOC 6011:573.564)
SOME INTERESTING DISCOVERIES. NOTHING OF MUCH INTEREST WAS FOUND
IN THE KAHDEON DELTA SYSTEM.
HOWEVER, IN KAHDEON EPSILON THERE WERE TWO FELYSIAN PLANETS.
BOTH VERY BEAUTIFUL AND HAD VARIED TERRAIN. THEY ARE NAMED
KHAZARSIS AND TRAELIA.
(NOTES BY STARDRIFTER FRACTUS, EPOC 6011:573.837)
I HAD TO GET MORE LITHIUM FROM A NEARBY STAR I NAMED
GAMLADRIFAL. THE DISTANCE TO THE KAHDEON ZETA SYSTEM IS A LITTLE
BIT OVER 9000 DYAMS, SO I'M IN FOR SOME WAITING.
NOTHING MUCH TO DO ON THE SHIP, THOUGH... I TOLD THE FELYSIAN
NAVY THAT WE SHOULD INSTALL A DATABASE OF FELYSIAN LITERATURE ON
HTE SHIP'S COMPUTER, BUT DID THEY LISTEN TO ME? NO. *SIGH*
(NOTES BY STARDRIFTER FRACTUS, EPOC 6011:573.938)
I HAVE NOW EXPLORED KAHDEON ZETA. THE PLANETS THERE WERE
QUITE INTERESTING. THE FIRST PLANET, JUFERON, IS COVERED BY
THICK ORANGE CLOUDS - IT LOOKS VERY NICE FROM ORBIT. THE SURFACE
IS ALSO PRETTY. THERE WERE THREE OTHER PLANETS, BUT NONE OF THEM
EXCEPTIONAL. ULEN IS UGLY, DARQUON MOVES FAST, AND ZEMREO IS
A STANDARD QUARTZ PLANET.
I HAVE ALSO GIVEN UP FURTHER EXPLORATION OF THE SYSTEM. THE
REASON FOR THIS IS THAT I'M NEAR THE MAIN STAR, KAHDEON ALPHA,
AND THE DISTANCE TO ETA IS ALMOST 58000 DYAMS. THE DISTANCE TO
THETA, ON THE OTHER HAND, IS ALMOST 477000 DYAMS.
IF SOMEONE WANT'S A CHALLENGE, YOU'RE FREE TO SCOUT THOSE TWO
OUT.
THERE'S EVEN A FELYSIAN PLANET ON ETA - IT'S THE FIFTH PLANET.
(NOTES BY STARDRIFTER FRACTUS, EPOC 6011:574.22 - LEAVING SYS.)

AN S00 STAR WITH 5 PLANETS AND 21 MOONS. SO NAMED BECAUSE OF THE BRANCH-
LIKE STRUCTURE OF THE NUMBERS OF BODIES; THE ONE SUN HAS FIVE PLANETS,
MANY OF WHICH HAVE SEVERAL MOONS; IT'S AS A TREE WITH BRANCHES. --EKA

ON THE THIRD PLANET AND IT'S COMING OUT QUITE WELL; SO FAR, EVERY PLANET
HAS BEEN UNUSUALLY INTERESTING AND NOTABLE. --EKA
ALL DONE! THEY'RE LABELED AND COMMENTED. THIS IS A RATHER NICE SYSTEM.
THE THIRD PLANET IS VERY BEAUTIFUL AND HAS A FEW INTERESTING MOONS. THE
LAST PLANET WAS FUN TO EXPLORE BECAUSE I FINALLY FOUND WHAT I WAS
LOOKING FOR. THE 3RD PLANET DOES HAVE A FELISIAN MOON, BUT ON IT I COULD
ONLY FIND DESERT-LIKE AREAS AND RAGING OCEANS; HOWEVER, NOW I THINK THAT
I KNOW HOW TO FIND THE SHORELINE. MAYBE I'LL DO THAT LATER. ANYWAY, I'D
SAY THIS SYSTEM IS WORTH A VISIT IF YOU'RE ANYWHERE NEAR 0,0,0. --EKA
I'VE DONE IT. I EXPLORED THE FELISIAN MOON AND I HAVE FOUND LIFE. THIS
IS GOOD, BUT THE REAL HIGHLIGHT HERE IS THE FACT THAT THE TRUNKS OF THE
TREES THERE WERE TRANSPARENT! IT WAS AMAZING, AND IT MAKES THIS STAR
WORTH A VISIT FROM VIRTUALLY ANYWHERE YOU MAY BE. THE MOON'S NAME IS
'DEMENTED' FROM THE VERY FIRST IMPRESSION I GOT UPON SEEING IT FROM
SPACE, AND I MUST SAY IT HAS LIVED UP TO ITS NAME. THE LOCATION OF THE
SEE-THROUGH TREES IS WRITTEN IN THE NOTES OF THE MOON ITSELF. THIS HAS
TURNED OUT TO BE A WONDEROUS SYSTEM. --EKA

THE EIGTH PLANET OF THIS SYSTEM HAS THREE MOONS ALL OF WHICH
HAVE LIFE ON THEM, DESPITE BEING NEARLY 300 DYAMS AWAY FROM
THEIR STAR! THESE MOONS ARE EXTREMELY COLD AND IT SEEMS TO BE A
MIRACLE THAT LIFE COULD EXIST HERE. THE REST OF THE SYSTEM IS
VERY MUCH SPREAD OUT, AND MOSTLY FULL OF BODIES WITH NO
ATMOSPHERE. AS OF EPOC6011 569 THIS STARDRIFTER HAS NOT EXPLORED
BEYOND THE 8TH PLANET, SO IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THERE COULD BE
MORE LIFE-HARBOURING MOONS IN THIS SYSTEM, BUT IT ISN'T VERY
LIKELY. (NOTES BY JILANTY EPOC6011 569.105)

1. THERE ARE SEVEN PLANETS, 6 MOONS IN THIS SYSTEM.
2. THERE IS ONE UNSTABLE MOON. ITS THE ONLY UNSTABLE BODY HERE.
3. THERE IS SENTIENT LIFE ON PLANET NUMBER 3, NAMED LILTANCE.
4. THERE ARE NO GAS PLANETS WITHIN ORBIT OF THIS STAR.

A S08-TYPE SYSTEM WITH 9 PROTOPLANETS AND 34 MOONS. LOOKS LIKE
WE GOT LOTS OF WORK TO BE DONE. OUR TECHNICIANS HAVE ALSO
REPORTED SUCSESS IN GETTING OUR MAINFRAME BACK, BUT IT IS NOT
CONNECTED TO INTERSTELLAR COMMUNICATION NETWORK. WHILE THEY TRY
TO FIX THIS PROBLE,, WE WILL BEGIN EXPLORING THIS NEW SYSTEM.
(STARGAZER. EPOC 6011; 584.886)
OUR HISTORIANS HAS NOW RECOGNISED WHY THIS SYSTEM GOT ITS NAME.
APPERENTLY, THIS SYSTEM WAS A DRAKHNATOR BASE IN THE GREAT WAR.
THE SYSTEM WAS LIBERATED NEAR THE END OF THE WAR, JUST TWO WEEKS
BEFORE THE DRAKHNATOR MOTHERSHIP BLEW UP INSIDE THE NODE TO THE
NEW GALAXY. THE SYSTEM WAS NEVER FOUND BY FELISIANS AGAIN, BEFORE
NOW THAT IS. DUE TO THIS FACT, OUR WEAPON AND SHEILDING SYSTEMS
ARE FULLY ONLINE AND PREPARED TO FIRE, SHOULD WE ENCOUNTER
AGRESSIVES OF ANY KIND. LONG AND NEAR-RANGE SENSORS HAS NOT
DETECTED ANYTHING TAHT COULD TREATH THE SD, BUT WE STILL NEED TO
BE ON FULL ALERT, JUST IN CASE ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN. EXPLORAITON
OF DRAKHNATORIA IS NOW COMMENCING AFTER PLAN, TWO WORLDS HAS
BEEN VISITED AND IDENTIFIED SO FAR. EXPLORAITON WILL CONTINIUE
ASAP. (STARGAZER. EPOC 6011; 584.886)
THIS SYETM IS WORTH VISITING BY FUTURE EXPLORERS, BOTH BECOUSE
OF THE TWO STRANGE FELISIAN WORLDS WE HAVE FOUND HERE, AND ALSO
BECOUSE OF THE PLANET DRAKHNATORIA PRIME.
WE NOW HAVE TO LEAVE THIS SYSTEM TO CONTINIUE OUR SEARCH FOR THE
LEGENDARY WORLD OF ANTYREN.
CONCLUSION: THIS SYSTEM IS A SYSTEM OF THE ANCIENTS, AND IS
DEFFINENTLY WORTH A RE-VISIT BY OTHER EXPLORERS.

I LANDED IN A TERRIBLE STORM, WHICH DISRUPTED BOTH MY VISION AND MY

IT WILL TAKE A LONG TIME REACHING THE GROUND IF YOU LAND HERE, DUE TO
THE VERY LOW GRAVITY. HOWEVER, THE SURFACE IS JUST AS GREEN AS IT

A NICE PURPLE MOON. -EPOC 6011 584.117.500 BY PROF.CALLAHAN.
NOW THIS IS INTERESTING FOR A MOON! CONGLOMOON 13 IS INTERNALLY
HOT, AND HAS AN UNSTABLE SURFACE... THE FIRST OF ITS KIND THAT
I HAVE ENCOUNTERED. IT ALSO HAS A GREAT NATURAL SPLENDOR IN ITS
BEAUTIFUL RED-LINED CRATERS! MARVELOUS!
LANDING IMPOSSIBLE, BUT IT'S GREAT TO LOOK AT!
-EPOC 6011 584.117.700 BY PROF.CALLAHAN.
THIS MOON IS SUITABLE FOR LIFE! I MUST EXPLORE IMMEDIATELY!!!
OH, AND IT IS THE FOURTH NAMED MOON OF CONGLOMO.
NAMED FOR TRIANGLE OF SPIRAL STORMS... FIRST LANDING:CENTER OF TRIAD.
THE CENTER OF THE TRIAD WAS VERY MOUNTAINOUS, FILLED WITH LIFE. WATER
WAS ALSO SPOTTED IN SMALL LAKES, AT 92-41, FACING SOUTH BY SOUTHWEST.
-EPOC 6011 584.57.980

DISCOVERED IN EPOC 6011.606.954.46 BY SEAN MCCOY AKA CLASSICO
INITIAL SURVEY HAS SHOWN THAT DULCEAS, DESPITE BEING LARGELY COMPOSED
OF QUARTZ, LACKS THE BEAUTY OF OTHER PLANETS OF THIS KIND.
THE SURFACE REVEALED BY THE INITIAL LANDING WAS ENTIRELY GREY, WITH
ONLY SCATTERED LUMPS OF CRYSTAL. SINCE THE ONBOARD COMPUTER TELLS ME
THAT THE PLANET'S SURFACE IS LARGELY QUARTZ, I CAN ONLY ASSUME THAT
THIS IS MOSTLY UNDER THE GREY CLAY-LIKE MATERIAL I LANDED UPON.
THERE IS A STRANGE, PERFECTLY SQUARE PATTERN VISIBLE FROM ORBIT
BETWEEN 6:60 AND 9:63, WHICH I CANNOT IDENTIFY. PERHAPS FURTHER
SURVEYS WILL SOLVE THIS MYSTERY.
(NOTES BY RYAN BURY, EPOC 6011:557,604)
FURTHER SURFACE EXAMINATION HAS SHOWN MORE OF THE STRANGE SQUARE
MARKINGS. I NOW BELIEVE THESE TO BE CAUSED BY REGULAR CRYSTAL
FORMATIONS.
(NOTES BY RYAN BURY, EPOC 6011:557.604)
I AGREE WITH MOST OF WHAT RYAN SAID. HOWEVER, I LIKE THIS PLANET. YES,
THE SURFACE'S RATHER DIRTY AND IT DOESN'T LOOK AS SHINY AS EXPECTED, BUT
SOMETIMES THERE ARE BEAUTIFUL HUGE CRYSTALS, FORMING AMAZING PEAKS.
ONE OF THESE FORMATIONS IS AT 28:56. I HAD LANDED THERE TO SEE THE
SUNRISE, AND DIDN'T REGRET IT. ONE LAST NOTE: DON'T LAND IN THE NIGHT!
(ADDITIONAL NOTES BY ALEX GHIGNOLA, EPOC 6011:557.937)
INITIAL SURVEY SHOWS THAT THE PLANET'S SURFACE IS EVERY BIT AS DARK
AS IT APPEARS FROM ORBIT. THE ATMOSPHERE IS A DEEP SHADE OF PURPLE.
THE SURFACE IS DOTTED WITH SMALL CLUMPS AND SPIKES OF MINERALS, WHICH
MAY BE METALLIC.
THE NEXT SURVEY WILL INVESTIGATE THE PLANET'S LARGE PINK SPOTS, WHICH
I BELIEVE TO BE CAUSED BY METEOR IMPACTS EXPOSING A LIGHTER MATERIAL
UNDER THE PLANET'S SURFACE, OR PERHAPS THE DARK BLUE/PURPLE SURFACE
REACTS TO FORM A PINK SUBSTANCE WHEN EXPOSED TO THE HEAT AN IMPACT
WOULD PRODUCE.
(NOTES BY RYAN BURY, EPOC 6011:557,605)
STRANGELY, THE SECOND SURVEY, WHICH PUT DOWN IN THE CENTRE OF ONE OF
THE PLANET'S PINK SPOTS, FOUND THAT THE AREA WAS COMPLETELY FLAT, THUS
DISPROVING THE METEOR THEORY. PERHAPS THESE PINK SPOTS ARE NATURALLY
OCCURRING MASS MINERAL DEPOSITS?
FURTHER INVESTIGATION INTO THIS MATTER IS HEREBY LEFT TO OTHER
STARDRIFTERS.
(NOTES BY RYAN BURY, EPOC 6011:557,606)
THIS PLANET, DESPITE ITS APPEARANCE FROM ORBIT, IS VERY DARK AND
DULL FROM THE SURFACE. I HAVE AS YET NO IDEA WHAT CAUSES THE 'GLOW'
THAT GIVES THIS WORLD ITS NAME.
(NOTES FROM THE PRIMARY SURVEY BY RYAN BURY, EPOC 6011:557,531)
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SURVEYS REVEALED THE PLANET'S SURFACE TO BE
HILLY, WITH GRASS BEING THE PREDOMINANT LIFEFORM. THE GRASS ITSELF
OCCURS IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT COLOURS, WITH BOTH GREY AND GREEN
VARIETIES HAVING BEEN NOTED TO DATE.
(NOTES TO THIS POINT BY RYAN BURY, EPOC 6011:557,521)
THE TERTIARY SURVEY HAS REVEALED THAT PEBREAH'S FLORA EXTENDS TO
LARGER ORGANISMS, SUCH AS TREES, AS WELL AS THE GRASS THAT COVERS THE
PLANET'S HILLY SURFACE.
(NOTES BY RYAN BURY, EPOC 6011:557,530)
IT NOW SEEMS THAT THE PLANET DOES SUPPORT SAPIENT LIFE-FORMS, IN THE
FORM OF ARIAL CREATURES, WHICH I HAVE WITNESSED IN THE NORTHERN POLAR
REGION. HOWEVER, NO DETAIL CAN YET BE GIVEN ON THESE CREATURES, AS
THEIR SPARSENESS AND CAUTION FOILED MY EFFORTS TO GET CLOSE TO THEM.
DUE TO ITS GREEN SURFACE, THIS MOON IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE PRETTIER VARIETY
OF THE MANY BARREN AIRLESS ROCKS THAT CAN BE FOUND IN THE GALAXY.

WELL... THIS IS INDEED AN INTERESTING FIND. FIRST OF ALL, THIS
IS THE 3RD COMPANION STAR TO POLYGAMY A, AND LIKE 'C' IT IS A

THIS STAR IS THAT IT IS OVER 700 DYAMS FROM POLYGAMY A. THAT'S
FOUR LIGHT YEARS!! THAT'S ENOUGH FOR THIS STARTO BE INDEPENDENT,
YET IT IS STILL SOMEHOW CAUGHT IN THE GRAVITY WELL OF THE POLYGAMY
SYSTEM. HOW FAR AWAY CAN A COMPANION STAR BE BEFORE IT CAN BE

DISCOVERED BY GARY! A LITTLE BEFORE EPOC 6011:572:825
IT SEEMS THAT ALMOST EVERY TIME I LAND, ITS RAINING. THERES ALSO TWO
DIFFERENT LAND ANIMALS, IN ADDITION TO BIRDS. THERE ARE ALSO STRANGE,
GLOWING GREEN TREES INTERSPERSED WITH THE NORMAL VARIETY.
MEDIUM-SIZED, SOLID, THICK ATMOSPHERE. ONLY A FEW SMALL, UNDEFINED
STORMS LIE AMONG THE MURKY, GREEN CLOUDS. AS COULD BE EXPECTED,
THERE ARE INTERESTING SIGHTS TO BEHOLD ON THE SURFACE. LANDING
NEAR THE TERMINATOR, YOU CAN IMMEDIATELY SEE THE STAR'S HUGE,
HIGHLY DEFORMED DISK LOOM ABOVE THE HORIZON. THIS HAS A VERY
GHASTLY LOOK. THE THICK ATMOSPHERE MUST BE BLOCKING MOST OF THE
HEAT, BECAUSE WHERE I LANDED, TEMPERATURES WERE 'ONLY' AROUND 80
DEGREES CELSIUS, AS OPPOSED TO MORE THAN 500 ON MY STARDRIFTER'S
ROOF. SERPENS, 6011 787.615
SMALL, SOLID, DUSTY... GENERALLY GREEN IN COLOUR. HIGHLY
REFLECTIVE, BUT THERE ARE SEVERAL PITCH BLACK SPOTS AMONG THE
GLARE. I COULDN'T NOTICE ANY CRATERS, OR ANY STANDING OUT
SURFACE FEATURES, FOR THIS MATTER. IT LOOKS RUGGED, MAYBE
MOUNTAINOUS, OR MAYBE SIMPLY DESTROYED BY A SERIES OF CATACLYSMS.
111.36: I DECIDED TO LAND AT ONE OF THOSE DARK SPOTS, AND YES, IT
REALLY WAS DARK. BEFORE LANDING, I ALSO SPOTTED A FAIRLY LARGE
CRATER ON THE NIGHT SIDE. ON THE SURFACE, HOWEVER, I WERE UNABLE
TO LOCATE ANY TERRAIN FEATURES OTHER THAN SOMEWHAT FLAT 'HILLS'.
112.60: CONSIDERABLY BRIGHTER, AND ALSO MORE REWARDING. THE SECTOR
WAS DOMINATED BY A GIANT, SOMEWHAT IRREGULAR CRATER, THE OPPOSITE
SLOPE OF WHICH GLOWED STRONGLY IN THE SUNLIGHT. CLOSE TO MY
LANDING LOCATION WAS A LARGE AND DEEP CHASM, WHICH I APPROACHED.
ONE OF ITS WALLS WAS SMOOTH AND VERY REFLECTIVE.
91.8: I EXPECTED A TREMENDOUSLY BRIGHT PLACE, BUT IT TURNED OUT TO
BE SIMPLY GREY. GREY AND, MIGHT I ADD, FLAT. THERE WAS LITERALLY
NOTHING OF NOTICEABLE SIZE IN SIGHT, MAYBE IN THE WHOLE SECTOR.
105.66: I TOOK MY LAST CHANCE AND IT WAS A GOOD DECISION. THIS
AREA, WHILE PLEASING ONE'S EYES WITH DARK GREEN COLOUR, SPORTS
TWO INTERESTING CHASMS, BOTH READILY VISIBLE DURING THE DESCENT.
I QUICKLY REACHED THE CLOSER ONE AND IT WAS NO USUAL HOLE IN THE
GROUND, BUT RATHER A FLAT PIECE OF LAND BETWEEN TWO SOMEWHAT LARGE
SLOPES. I'M GLAD THAT I DIDN'T IGNORE THIS PLANET, LIKE I OFTEN
USED TO DO IN THE PAST. SERPENS, 6011 787.616
OH, I SHOULD HAVE EXPECTED THIS - A FELYSIAN PLANET. ON THE
USUAL PLACE, ACTUALLY, BUT CONSIDERING THE LACK OF MOONS, I
THOUGHT IT WOULD BE RATHER IMPROBABLE. BUT HERE IT IS. MANY BLUE
STORMCLOUDS COVERING THE SURFACE, WHICH HAS A HUE SOMEWHERE
BETWEEN PURPLE AND VIOLET. I CAN BARELY TELL.
323.60: I THINK I FORGOT TO MENTION THE PLANET'S SMALL RING
BEFORE. ALSO, JUDGING FROM THE ORBIT, THERE'S LITTLE WATER ON THE
SURFACE, AND THE LANDING MAP CLEARLY INDICATED THAT I'LL BE
DESCENDING UPON DRY LAND. BUT IT TURNED OUT TO BE A FROZEN SEA,
WITH NOTHING BUT ICE IN ALL DIRECTIONS.
317.59: IRRITATED BY MY PREVIOUS LANDING, THIS TIME I CHOSE A
REAL SEA FOR MY TARGET. THERE WAS WATER (IN LIQUID STATE) AND EVEN
AN 'ISLAND', OR RATHER A TINY, TINY SPECK OF LAND. CURIOUSLY, IT
WAS COVERED BY GRASS, AND I SAW A BIRD CIRCLING AROUND IT. A WHILE
LATER, TWO SIMILAR BIRDS WERE FLYING CLOSE TO MY LANDER.
353.59: A SUNRISE I WANTED AND A SUNRISE I GOT, BUT THE SECTOR
WAS JUST A FLAT, FROZEN PLAIN. QUITE UNUSUAL CONDITIONS FOR THE
EQUATOR, EH? BUT I DID FIND A SLIM CHARGER AMONG ALL THE FROST.
345.27: LOTS OF ICE AGAIN, COMPLETE WITH A FROZEN LAKE (EASILY
SEEN FROM THE CUPOLA) AND VERY CLOUDY, BUT BRIGHT SKY. I DON'T
THINK THIS IS SIMPLY WINTER HERE.
313.20: AHH, FINALLY AN OASIS OF LIFE! A WONDERFUL PLACE, THE SKY
VERY BRIGHT, SUN SHINING INTENSELY, WATER IN THE DISTANCE, AND
LOTS OF VEGETATION, INCLUDING MANY, MANY GREEN TREES AROUND THE
LANDING SPOT. I CAME UPON THE WATER, THEN PROCEEDED TO A PROMINENT
HILL TO THE NORTHEAST. TERRAIN TO THE SOUTHWESTERN DIRECTION ALSO
OFFERED MANY GORGEOUS LANDSCAPES. THE ONLY ADEQUATE WORDS WHICH
I'M ABLE TO FIND ARE 'SAPPHIRES IN A GOLDEN POT'. NOW I MUST TRY
AGAIN AROUND THE EQUATOR.
285.57: NOT AS STUNNING AS THE PREVIOUS SECTOR, BUT A VERY PRETTY
PLACE NONETHELESS, ESPECIALLY WITH THE CALM, GREEN SKY. THERE'S A
LAKE IN THE DISTANCE, AND IN THE AIR ABOVE IT, I COUNTED AT LEAST
TEN BIRDS! SOME BUSHES AND A HOPPER WERE ALSO AROUND.
310.10: MY LAST LANDING. THERE WAS MOSTLY FROZEN WATER, WITH
COUNTLESS TINY 'ISLANDS' OF LAND COVERED BY PERMAFROST. ANIMAL
LIFE WAS SUPRISINGLY NUMEROUS, AND THE BEAUTIFUL SKY GIFTED THIS
PLACE WITH A GREAT ATMOSPHERE. SERPENS, 6011 787.622

OBJECTS STOOD THERE, ONE OF THEM ESPECIALLY REGULAR. I DON'T
KNOW IF THEY CAN BE ARTIFICIAL, ALL I REMEMBER IS THAT SKINNYMON
FOUND SOMETHING SIMILAR ELSEWHERE. PROBABLY THEY'RE SOME WEIRD

MANY BIRDS + ANIMALS SEEN. ANIMAL COLOR ALMOST SAME AS 'GRASS'.
FURTHER NOTES: AT 215.60, PRETTY MUCH ROLLING GROUND WITH A
VARIETY OF BUSHY PLANTS; TWO PEAKS DOMINATE THE SKYLINE- ONE BEING
PARTICULARLY TALL AND ALMOST MESA-LIKE. AT 39.18 IT'S PRETTY MUCH
HILLY, ICY, BARREN GROUND. AT 262.83, IT IS FORESTED WITH MANY
LARGE TREES, SPOTTED HOPPERS AND A FEW BIRDS. THREE INTERSTING
PEAKS ARE VISIBLE AT SOME DISTANCE AWAY FROM THE LANDING SITE.

MOON 9 OF PLANET 3 IN POWRPUFF SYSTEM. FELISIAN.
EXPLORED BY RICHARD SOLENSKY EPOC 6011-584.050.860
COLD AND BARREN, NOTHING OF INTEREST FOUND.
SETTING DOWN AT 359:60, THE FIRST THING I NOTICED WAS THE LARGE PEAK
WHICH DOMINATED THE LANDSCAPE. HEADING CLOSER REVEALED IT TO BE A
PERFECT PYRAMID - PERHAPS, UNDER THE GRASS WHICH COVERS IT, THERE LIES
A STRUCTURE BUILT BY A LONG FORGOTTEN CIVILISATION.
THE PLANET IS WARM AND MAINLY INHABITED BY BIRDS. THERE'S SOME
INTERESTNG VEGETATION TOO. (XEN MARMARIS, 6011:563.666)
DISCOVERED BY VERDULUM, EPOC 6011:560,864
WILDLIFE CONSISTS OF LARGE WHITE HARES AND SMALL BIRDS.
A LARGE CRATER IS EVIDENCE OF IMPACT WITH A SMALL MOON.
COLLISION WITH SMALL MOON MAY HAVE ALTERED PLANETS ORBIT.
AVERAGE TEMP. -123 DEGREES CELCIUS
SOME PARTS OF THIS PLANET ARE RICH IN VEGETATION AND PRONE
TO ELECTRICAL STORMS, OTHERS ARE FROZEN ISLANDS MOORED IN
ICE. BOTH TYPES OF TERRAIN SUPPORT LIFE.

LARGE CANYONS COVER THE EXPLORED AREA.
CANYONS CALCULATED TO BE APPROX. 890 METERS DEEP
THE DISCOVERY OF A SECOND PLANET ONCE INHABITED, NOW FROZEN
INDICATES THAT PERHAPS THE STAR, THALASK, IS COOLING.
IT'S AMAZING THAT SUCH A COLD, BARREN PLANET HARBOURS LIFE!
MANY OF THE LIFE-FORMS SEEMED TO BE STILL UNTIL DISTURBED -
PERHAPS THEY WERE CONSERVING ENERGY? WITH NO VISIBLE PLANT LIFE
I WONDER HOW THE ANIMALS SURVIVE - I SAW NO EVIDENCE OF
CARNIVOROUS ACTIVITY! THE FROZEN LAKE NEAR 228:59 IS PRETTY.

LIFE. IT IS ALSO COVERED WITH HILLS, MOUNTAINS, AND OCEANS, AND HAS
DEFINITE LANDFORMS SEEN FROM SPACE.
(NOTES BY JEFF KEMP EPOC 6011:623:981)
GREYISH PLANET FROM SPACE, HOWEVER, IT IS GREEN TO GREY IN CERTAIN
AREAS. DESERTS ARE RED, PLANT LIFE USUALLY THRIVES NEAR THE OCEAN.
THE ATMOSPHERE IS BLUE, TO GREEN IN DESERTS.
(NOTES BY JEFF KEMP EPOC 6011:623:981)
PLANET HAS SURFACE COLORS RANGING IN SHADES OF YELLOW, AND SOME SURFACE
FEATURES INCLUDE MOUNTAINS, CRATERS, HILLS, AND OTHER SUCH STUFF.
IT ALSO HAS SOME SIGNIFICANT DEBRIS RINGS.
(NOTES BY JEFF KEMP EPOC 6011:623:982)
PLANET SEEMS TO HAVE SEVERAL LARGE STORMS, THE WHITE SWIRLING CLOUDS.
I EXPLORED ONE OF THESE LOCATIONS AND DISCOVERED A VAST MOUNTAIN RANGE.
NO SIGNS OF LIFE YET, HOWEVER I BELIEVE IT EXISTS ON OTHER PARTS.
AFTER EXPLORING CALMER PLACES I HAVE FOUND NO WATER. LIFE IS NOT LIKELY
TO EXIST.
A SMALL, HOT, DUSTY, LIFELESS PLANET WITH NO ATMOSPHERE
A QUICK SURFACE VISIT DIDN'T FIND ANY UNUSUAL LANDMARKS
THE PLANET HAS FAIRLY NORMAL DAY LENGTHS
THE PULSAR AMY FAILS TO BRIGHTEN THE PLANET SIGNIFICANTLY
BELCH, EPOC 6011:607:825

I LANDED IN A SEA, WHICH IS A BEATIFUL SHADE OF BLUE-GREEN, AND MAKES
PURPLE RIPPLES WHEN SWUM IN. I DID FIND A SINGLE AQUATIC BIRD.
DISCOVERED BY LOGAN WALKER, EPOC 6011.612.820
THE AREA I LANDED IN WAS FROZEN AND GRAY, SURROUNDED BY A SEA OF ICE.
I OBSERVED SEVERAL FLYING INSECTS, A BIRD, AND AN ODD HOPPING
CREATURE. (NOTES BY LOGAN WALKER, EPOC 6011.612.821)
I LANDED NEAR THE EQUATOR, AND FOUND A BEATIFUL PLAIN, WITH YELLOW
SHRUBBERY WITH GLASS-LIKE STEMS. THE WATER IS PINK, THE GROUND IS A

DARK TWILIGHT.
NOTES BY JUS EPOC 6011.578.513
A THICK ATMOSPHERE WORLD WITH BRIGHT PINK STORMS. NICE LOOKING FROM
ORBIT, BUT THE SURFACE IS EXTREMELY DARK. WATCH OUT WHEREVER YOU LAND,
YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SEE YOUR SURFACE POD WHILE STANDING NEXT TO IT,
EVEN IF LANDING DURING THE DAY.(NOTES BY NEUZD 6011 786:950)
THIS PLANET HAS TREES BUT NO LIFE WAS FOUND YET
THIS IS THE STANGEST THING I EVER SAW!
PRELIMENARY LANDING SHOWED SOME INTERESTING PYRAMIDAL RUINS AND

YOUR CLASSIC CHUNK OF SPACE ROCK, NO INDIGENOUS LIFE, NO
ATMOSPHERE PRESENT, ETC, ETC.
(NOTES BY N5CORP ON 6011:617.800)
NOT THE LIFE OF THE PARTY WHEN IT COMES TO PLANETS. A LARGE BRIGHT
SPOT IN THE CLOUDS MAY BE A MASSIVE STORM OF SOME SORT, ALMOST MAKES
ONE WANT TO BE ABLE TO SEE IT FROM THE SURFACE.
(NOTES BY N5CORP ON 6011:617.811)
NICE TO LOOK AT, PAX IS COVERED WITH DENSE CLOUDS, AND HAS AN INCOSISTENT
SURFACE. ONE WANDERS WHAT THE CLOUDS WOULD LOOK LIKE FROM THE SURFACE.
(NOTES BY N5CORP ON 6011:617.814)
BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE, I DON'T SUGGEST TRYING TO EXPLORE THE SUFACE
UNLESS YOU LIKE GETTING LOST IN THE PITCH DARK. COMPLETELY COVERED
BY CLOUDS PRETTY MUCH SAYS IT ALL.
(NOTES BY N5CORP ON 6011:617.812)
A GREAT CANIDATE OF ANY STEREO-TYPICAL MOON CONTEST, GREAT FOR ANY
SPORT THAT WOULD BE ENHANCED BY LOW GRAVITY.
(NOTES BY N5CORP ON 6011:617.812)

AS SOON AS YOU CAN, SIT DOWN ON THIS MOON AND TAKE A STROLL, YOU'LL
NOTICE THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE THROUGH THE GROUND! VERY AWESOME.

WALKERS, AND RUNNERS AND SUCH.(NOTE BY N5CORP ON 6011:617.816)
AT FIRST, I FIGURED THIS WOULD END UP BEING ANOTHER DULL QUARTZ WORLD
THEN I LANDED AT 219.54. I WAS DROPPED INTO A FEILD WHERE HUGE QUARTZ

THIS STAR WAS NAMED AFTER ASHRON, A FELLOW STAR DRIFTER AND
FRIEND WHO LOST HIS LIFE TO A LITHIUM EATER
HMM, THIS STAR MIGHT BE LARGE, BUT IT'S ALSO RATHER COLD. BUT NEVER
MIND. THIS PLANET IS MEDIUM-SIZED AND HAS A THICK ATMOSPHERE. THE
CLOUDS ARE GREEN, VERY BRIGHT AND RATHER UNIFORM, ALMOST NO
DISTINCT STORMS CAN BE SEEN FROM ORBIT. DOWN THERE, OF COURSE, THE
GIANT STAR IS EXTREMELY PROMINENT ON THE SKY, TAKING UP CONSIDERABLE
SPACE WITH ITS POWERFUL GLOW. I LANDED NEXT TO A CHASM, APPROACHED
IT CARELESSLY AND MANAGED TO FALL IN THERE. PLAYFUL, EH?
SERPENS, 6011 787.707
I ALREADY SAW IT FROM NO 1'S ORBIT, AND NO DOUBT, BECAUSE WHAT WE
HAVE HERE IS A GAS GIANT. ITS USUAL DESCRIPTION - LARGE, NOT
CONSISTENT ETC. - IF PAINFULLY INSUFFICIENT. THIS PLANET LOOKS A
LOT LIKE FAL GALMATRIFAL, PERHAPS BEING EVEN BRIGHTER AND HAVING
MORE WELL DEFINED, GOLDEN SPOTS. THE STUNNING IMPRESSION IS
COMPLETED WITH A RING SEEN PERFECTLY EDGE-ON. SERPENS, 6011 707.708
THIS ONE COULD ALSO BE SEEN ALREADY FROM PLANET 1. A RINGED (AND
THE RING IS VERY, VERY PRETTY) SUBSTELLAR OBJECT HOSTING SIX OR
SEVEN, MAYBE EVEN EIGHT MOONS. AT LEAST ONE OF THEM SEEMS TO BE A
GAS GIANT. SERPENS, 6011 787.708
SMALL, SOLID, DUSTY... OH, WELL, THIS IS AN EXCEPTIONAL OBJECT.
MAYBE MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL, BEING A VERY SMALL PLANET, IT ACTUALLY
HAS A MOON WHICH IS VISIBLY LARGER! MUST BE SOME WEIRD MASS ISSUE,
OR THE SENSORS GOT CONFUSED. SECOND, UPON APPROACH A SPLENDID RING
CAN BE IMMEDIATELY SEEN, AND AT A BEAUTIFUL ANGLE! THE PHOTOGRAPHIC
OPPORTUNITY IS OBVIOUS. THIRD, SAYING 'GREEN' DOES NO JUSTICE TO
THIS PLANET. WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS ALL SHADES AND HUES OF GREEN,
RANGING FROM VERY DIM TO EXTREMELY BRIGHT. THE REFLECTIVITY IS
HIGHLY VARIED INDEED. WHY? PERHAPS IT'S CAUSED BY THE ENORMOUS,
WONDERFUL IMPACT CRATERS WHICH, AT THE TIME OF MY ARRIVAL, COVERED
MORE THAN HALF OF THE DAYLIT HEMISPHERE. SERPENS, 6011 787.715
A GAS GIANT WITH ABOUT SEVEN MOONS - THAT'S HOW MANY I MANAGED TO
COUNT, AT LEAST. IT HAS A RING, A LARGE, BEAUTIFULLY TILTED RING.
THE ATMOSPHERE, SOMEWHAT LESS SPECTACULAR, IS STILL INTERESTING,
SOMEWHAT DARK, WITH BROWN, GREY AND BLACK COLOURS ALL MAKING THEIR
APPEARANCE. QUITE A FEW STORMS, TOO, WHICH APPEAR TO BE SLIGHTLY
ABOVE THE NORM IN TERMS OF SIZE. SERPENS, 6011 787.757
A MEDIUM-SIZED WORLD, QUARTZ SURFACE, OXYGEN ATMOSPHERE. GREEN
AGAIN, I'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND WHY THIS COLOUR APPEARS SO OFTEN. FROM
ORBIT, IT LOOKS RATHER USUAL, WITH SLIGHTLY VARIED TERRAIN AND MANY
VERY BRIGHT SPOTS, SHINING AS QUARTZ SHOULD. THREE MOONS HERE, ONE
OF WHICH SEEMS TO BE SOMEWHAT LARGE. THE PLANET ALSO HAS A BIG, BUT
INCREDIBLY THIN RING WHICH LOOKS LIKE A LOOSE, ROUND STRING OF
SAND GRAINS CIRCLING THE GLOBE. I DID LAND, BUT FAILED TO FIND
ANYTHING SIGNIFICANT, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF GRAVITY EXCEEDING 1.3
FELYSIAN. THE ATMOSPHERE WAS UNPROPORTIONALLY THIN.
SERPENS, 6011 787.761
MEDIUM-SIZED, ROCKY, CREASED. IT'S GREEN, IT HAS BASICALLY NO
SURFACE FEATURES AND NO MOONS, BUT IT DOES HAVE A HUGE, AMAZINGLY
BEAUTIFUL RING, SO IT'S ACTUALLY A SHAME THAT THERE ARE NO MOONS...
THE RING IS BEST VISIBLE DURING THE APPROACH AND IN FAR CHASE MODE.
HIGH SPEED ORBIT CAN ALSO PROVIDE SOME VERY SPECTACULAR SIGHTS,
BUT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO CATCH THE WHOLE RING, IT'S SIMPLY SO
LARGE. LANDING DIDN'T BRING ANY SUPRISES, NOT COUNTING THE HIGH
GRAVITY, BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER. REALLY, WHAT MATTERS IS THE RING.
MYSELF, I CAN'T THINK OF A BETTER WAY OF PHOTOGRAPHING IT THAN TO
FLY BACK AND FORTH, FROM PLANET 6 TO HERE AND VICE VERSA. TEDIOUS,
I REALIZE, BUT IT'S WORTH IT. EVEN FAR CHASE MODE DOESN'T ALLOW
TO CAPTURE ITS TRUE GLORY. SERPENS, 6011 787.763
THE DISTANCES ARE SLOWLY GROWING, ALREADY WAY OVER 100 DYAMS TO THIS
MEDIUM-SIZED QUARTZ PLANET WHICH AGAIN HAS THREE MOONS. I WOULD SAY
THAT IT'S GOLDEN, BUT ONLY IF IT WASN'T SO BLEAK. NOW THE BEST I CAN
SAY IS 'YELLOW'. I LANDED AT 289.11, A SOMEWHAT DARK SPOTS (THEY ARE
PLENTIFUL, FAR MORE THAN BRIGHT ONES, WHICH ARE LARGER INSTEAD).
THERE WAS AN EXTENSIVE PLATEU LEADING STRAIGHT TO A PEAK READILY
VISIBLE TO THE SOUTH - OR WAS IT NORTH? LOOKING CLOSELY, A WIDE
RIFT IN THE GROUND COULD BE SEEN JUST BEYOND THE MOUNTAIN. I
VISITED AND EXPLORED THIS SPECTACULAR TERRAIN, BUT REMEMBER THAT
THE CONDITIONS (INCLUDING THE STAR'S WEIRD APPEARANCE, ONLY VISIBLE
FROM THE CUPOLA) ARE STRANGE, AND THE LANDER'S BEAM MIGHT EASILY GET
LOST IN THE SKY'S GLARE. I'D RECOMMEND KEEPING COLD BLOOD AND
STEERING BY THE COMPASS. SERPENS, 6011 787.764
SMALL, SOLID, DUSTY, CRATERIZED. NO MOONS. PERHAPS IT'S MORE OF
AN ASTEROID THAN A REAL PLANET? FROM ORBIT, IT'S GREENISH (OF
COURSE...), SOMEWHAT BLEAK, BUT THIS IS PROBABLY DUE TO THE DISTACE
FROM ITS STAR. SOME REGIONS APPEAR TO BE VERY REFLECTIVE AND WOULD
CLEARLY BE EQUALLY BRIGHT IF PUT CLOSER TO THE STAR. THERE ARE
LARGE CRATERS, INCLUDING ONE AREA WHERE THEY'RE ESPECIALLY NUMEROUS.
THIS AREA IS QUITE INTERESTING - BRIGHT AND DARK REGIONS COEXIST
THERE, DIVIDED BY CRATERS OF VARIOUS SIZES. I TRIED TO LAND ONCE,
BUT DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING EXCEPT FOR FLAT TERRAIN. THE STAR WAS JUST
A BRIGHT DOT IN THE SKY. SERPENS, 6011 787.842
THE TENTH PLANET ALREADY. MEDIUM-SIZED, SOLID, THICK ATMOSPHERE. IT
HAS TWO OR THREE MOONS, I CAN'T REMEMBER EXACTLY, BUT MORE LIKELY
TWO. THE CLOUDS ARE BROWN, RATHER DARK AND SUPRISINGLY PLEASANT
TO THE EYE. A DARK, HIGHLY DISRUPTED BELT SITS AROUND THE NORTHERN
TROPIC, AND SEVERAL ROUND STORMS OF VARIOUS SIZES ARE STREWN AROUND
THE ATMOSPHERE. I LANDED AT 177.60. EVERYTHING THERE WAS STRANGELY
BRIGHT, WHICH I DIDN'T EXPECT, BUT ALSO VERY BLEAK. STILL, TWO
CHASMS WERE READILY VISIBLE AND I DECIDED TO APPROACH THE CLOSER
ONE. ON THE SPOT, IT TURNED OUT THAT ITS WALLS GLOW BRIGHT ENOUGH
TO HURT THE EYES, SO I HURRIEDLY TOOK SOME PHOTOS AND IMMEDIATELY
WENT BACK. SERPENS, 6011 787.870
ALREADY 430 DYAMS AWAY FROM PLANET 10, SO I SPENT A GOOD WHILE
LOOKING THROUGH THE WINDOW, AND IT WILL GET LONGER. DO I HAVE
ENOUGH LITHIUM TO REACH PLANET 18? BUT ANYWAY, THIS IS A SMALL,
SOLID, DUSTY ETC. WORLD, B UT DESPITE BEING GREEN, IT'S NOTHING
LIKE I EXPECTED. IN FACT, THE SURFACE LOOKS FAR MORE LIKE A QUARTZ
WORLD OR A CREASED ONE. I'VE BEEN UNABLE TO SPOT ANY LARGER
FEATURES. INSTEAD, THE PLANET HAS A ROUGH LOOK AND HOSTS NUMEROUS,
SMALL DARKER AND BRIGHTER AREAS, WHICH RANGE FROM PITCH BLACK TO
FEROCIOUSLY SHINING. A COMMON SIGHT WHEN IT COMES TO QUARTZ WORLDS,
BUT NOT HERE. INTERESTINGLY, ON THE SURFACE IT SHOULD BE BRIGHT
ENOUGH TO FIND YOUR WAY EASILY REGARDLESS OF WHERE YOU LAND.
SERPENS, 6011 788.16
OVER 800 DYAMS THIS TIME. ON THE WAY, MY STARDRIFTER PASSED CLOSE
ENOUGH TO THE PRIMARY STAR TO FEEL ITS WARM LIGHT, BUT NOW I'M
IN COLD SPACE AGAIN. SO, A MEDIUM-SIZED, ROCKY, CREASED PLANET WITH
TWO MOONS. IF THE DESCRIPTION EQUALS 'BORING' TO YOU, KNOW THAT
THIS IS NOT THE CASE. IT'S SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT TO TELL WHAT THE
MAIN COLOURS IS - PART YELLOW, PART BROWN, AND MAYBE EVEN SOME
GREEN INFLUENCES. BUT THE VIEW IS STILL DOMINATED BY PLENTIFUL
DARK AREAS AND AT LEAST SEVERAL CRATERS OF NOTICEABLE SIZE. ONE OF
THEM WAS CAUSED BY A REAL CATASTROPHE. SERPENS, 6011 788.16
THE THIRTEENTH PLANET... A SHORTER TRIP THIS TIME, PROBABLY BECAUSE
IT WAS ON THE 'CORRECT' SIDE OF THE SYSTEM. SMALL, SOLID, DUSTY,
CRATERIZED. GENERALLY, IT'S GREEN, BUT APPEARS SOMEWHAT YELLOWISH,
AND THIS IS DUE TO ITS REFLECTIVITY. I'M SURE THAT CLOSER TO THE
STAR, IT WOULD SHINE OVERWHELMINGLY. EVEN NOW, THE CRATER INTERIORS
(THERE ARE SOME CRATERS) ARE ALMOST WHITE. BUT THE COLOURS ARE
DIM AND BLEAK, AS SHOULD BE EXPECTED HERE. DESCENDING AT 212.55
PRODUCED INTERESTING TERRAIN, FOR EXAMPLE SOMETHING LIKE A HALF
DESTROYED CRATER WAS RIGHT NEXT TO THE LANDING LOCATION. QUITE
BRIGHT DOWN THERE, TOO. SERPENS, 6011 788.52
PLANET NUMBER 14... IT WAS A VERY LONG JOURNEY, OVER 1400 DYAMS.
BUT IT WAS WORTH IT. SMALL, SOLID, ICY, THIS IS AN UNIQUE WORLD.
FIRST, ITS APPEARANCE IS NOT MUCH LIKE OTHER OBJECTS OF ITS KIND.
IT'S RATHER DARK. THE USUAL STREAKS ARE PRESENT, BUT ALMOST
INVISIBLE AMONG THE SUPRISING VARIETY OF BRIGHTER OR DARKER AREAS
OF IRREGULAR SHAPE, JUST LIKE ON CREASED WORLDS. PLUS, SOME
FORMATIONS LOOK SUSPICIOUSLY LIKE CRATERS. RANDOMLY CHOSEN SECTORS
WERE STILL COMPLETELY FLAT, THOUGH. AND SECOND, THIS PLANET HAS A
RING OF ABNORMAL SIZE. BEING UNFORTUNATELY EDGE-ON, IT STILL
MANAGES TO AMAZE BY ITS SHEER SCALE. THERE'S NO WAY TO CAPTURE IT
COMPLETELY ON A PHOTO, BUT THE PLANET HAS A MOON, SO THIS SHOULD
BE INTERESTING. SERPENS, 6011 788.54
ALREADY A LONG, LONG WAY OUT... 2200 DYAMS FROM PLANET 14. I COULD
SEE THE STARS MOVE SLIGHTLY AGAINST THE BLACK BACKGROUND. THE
SYSTEM SAYS '0.04 L.Y.' ALREADY, AND THERE ARE CURRENTLY STILL
500 DYAMS TO GO. I WONDER HOW FAR THE OTHER PLANETS WILL BE.
WSHEW, FINALLY THERE! THIS IS A MEDIUM-SIZED QUARTZ PLANET WITH
TWO MOONS. ITS COLOURS IS - GUESS WHAT - GREEN. THE USUAL SHADE
VARIETY IS PRESENT, SURFACE AREAS RANGING FROM (RELATIVELY) VERY
BRIGHT TO VERY DARK SPOTS, BUT THERE'S MAYBE ONE REALLY DARK, WHICH
MEANS MOUNTAINOUS, PLACE. I LANDED THERE (140.60)... QUITE BRIGHT
THERE, ACTUALLY. VERY HIGH GRAVITY. MOUNTAINS FOUND, BUT THEY WERE
MERE DWARFS AS COMPARED TO ANALOGICAL PLACES ON OTHER SUCH WORLDS.
SERPENS, 6011 788.99
HMM, 5311 DYAMS AND IT'S ON THE DIRECTLY OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE
PLANETARY SYSTEM. I'LL JUST WAIT...
...AND HERE I AM, AFTER CUTTING THE JOURNEY'S TIME A BIT BY
REAPPROACHING THE STAR. SMALL, SOLID, ICY, THIS LONELY, FROZEN
PLANET IS ACTUALLY DARK VIOLET, WITH A SLIGHT INCLINATION TOWARDS
PURPLE. DESPITE THE DARKNESS, STREAKS SCARRING THE WHOLE SURFACE
CAN BE CLEARLY SEEN. AND NO, I'M NOT TRYING TO LAND HERE.
SERPENS, 6011 788.119
OH, A SUBSTELLAR OBJECT WITH OVER TEN MOONS - EXACTLY WHAT YOU
WOULD EXPECT ON THE VERY OUTER FRINGES OF A LARGE PLANETARY SYSTEM.
I'LL ADMIT, THOUGH, THAT THE APPROACH WAS BEAUTIFUL, FIRST BECAUSE
THE MOONS' ORBITS ARE TILTED ALL IN A DIFFERENT WAY, AND SECOND
BECAUSE OF THE WONDERFUL RING THIS SUBSTELLAR OBJECT HAS. THIS IS
GOING TO BE SPECTACULAR AS SEEN FROM ITS SATELLITES (ONE OF THESE
IS PROBABLY GOING TE BE FELYSIAN). SERPENS, 6011 788.120
I'M WRITING THIS AS MY TRIP THERE ONLY BEGINS, AGAIN IN THE STAR'S
WARM LIGHT. I REAPPROACHED IT TO SHORTEN THE DISTANCE, BUT THIS
WAS A MISTAKE, BECAUSE IT'S ACTUALLY FARTHER FROM THERE... BUT I
ALSO COULD READ THE PLANET FINDER'S OUTPUT AND IT TOLD ME THAT THIS
IS THE VERY LAST CELESTIAL BODY OF THIS SYSTEM. UNLESS THE FINDER
IS WRONG, IT HAS NO MOONS. 3880 DYAMS REMAINING...
AND THE JOURNEY'S OVER. MEDIUM-SIZED, QUARTZ PLANET, IT'S
COMPLETELY UNLIKE OTHER WORLDS OF ITS KIND. AT THIS DISTANCE, IT'S
VERY, VERY DARK, BROWN, AND SIMPLY CREEPY, BEING SO DIFFERENT.
IT'S ALIEN. EVEN MORE STRANGELY, IT'S EXTREMELY BRIGHT ON THE
SURFACE, AND THE GROUND IS MORE LIKE SAND THAN QUARTZ. INTERESTING
TERRAIN, TOO. BUT I AM DONE HERE, NOW I'LL REFUEL (64 GRAMS OF
LITHIUM REMAINING FROM THE INITIAL 120!), AND THEN TAKE A REST AT
SURICRASIA. SERPENS, 6011 788.149
MEDIUM-SIZED, SOLID, THICK ATMOSPHERE. THERE'S A STORM IN THE
SOUTH POLE'S VICINITY, WHICH IS ALSO MEDIUM-SIZED. THE PLANET'S
(OR RATHER MOON'S... I KEEP MAKING THIS MISTAKE) APPEARANCE, BEING
REDISH TO ORANGE, IS A BIT DISTURBING, SLIGHTLY INFERNAL EVEN.
IT WAS VERY BRIGHT ON THE SURFACE, BUT OF MORE SIGNIFICANCE WAS
THE SUBSTELLAR OBJECT'S CURRENT POSITION, WHICH ALLOWED FOR A
GREAT PHOTO OF THIS INTERESTING PAIR. SERPENS, 6011 787.708
THIS OBJECT IS OF THE SAME TYPE AS THE PREVIOUS ONE. VERY YELLOW,
MAYBE MUSTARD, AND ON FIRST SIGHT, IT APPEARED TO BE EVEN MORE
UNIFORM THAN PLANET ONE. THIS ISN'T TRUE, HOWEVER, AS QUITE A FEW
MINOR, BUT VERY PRETTY STORMS CAN BE SEEN AMONG THE CLOUDS,
STANDING OUT WITH THEIR GOLDEN HUE. QUITE SPECTACULAR. THE
SUBSTELLAR OBJECT, ALTHOUGH MORE DISTANT THIS TIME, AGAIN WAS ON
THE RIGHT SPOT, ALLOWING FOR A VERY GOOD PICTURE, ON WHICH A
TOTAL OF FOUR MOONS WAS CAPTURED. SERPENS, 6011 787.708
SMALL, SOLID, THIN ATMOSPHERE. FROM THE ORBIT, IT'S RATHER, SAY,
INCONSPICUOUS, DARK RED IN COLOUR, BUT BY NO MEANS SPECTACULAR.
I TRIED TO LAND, AND THE SURFACE GREETED ME WITH A RUGGED, ROUGH
TERRAND AND A VERY BEAUTIFUL SKY. I'D RECOMMEND CHECKING THIS OUT,
IN MY OPINION IT COULD EVEN RIVAL SURICRASIA, ALTHOUGH THE
SENSATIONS ARE SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT - HERE, WE HAVE A SERENE, CALMLY
BLUE INFINITY. THE SUBSTELLAR OBJECT, AMAZINGLY, WAS *AGAIN* WHERE
IT SHOULD BE FOR A GOOD PHOTO, ALTHOUGH NOW IT WAS BUT A BRIGHT
SPOT WITH A HORIZONTAL LINE THROUGH IT. SERPENS, 6011 787.709
ANOTHER OF THE THICK ATMOSPHERE KIND, FOURHT ALREADY. THEY MUST
BE ESPECIALLY POPULAR HERE FOR SOME REASON. THIS ONE IS, MOSTLY,
DEEP GREEN, BUT IT ALSO HAS MANY IRREGULAR, PALE GREY SPOTS, AND
A FEW STORMS, THE COLOUR OF WHICH I CAN'T DESCRIBE. THE ATMOSPHERE
IS, THEN, SOMEWHAT TURBULENT, EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE NO GIANT
STORMS COVERING HALF OF THE HEMISPHERE, AS IT SOMETIMES HAPPENS.
BEFORE I FORGET, THERE IS ONE MOVE, VERY STRIKING FEATURE - A
PITCH BLACK, WIDE BELT CUTTING THROUGH THE CLOUDS NEAR THE
SOUTHERN TROPIC. ITS DARKNESS IS EXTREME, AND THIS IS WHAT MAKES
THIS MOON TRULY UNIQUE. LANDING THERE SHOWED THAT THE PRESSURE
IS EXCEPTIONALLY LOW HERE, 'ONLY' AROUND 15 ATMOSPHERES.
IRONICALLY, EVERYTHING WAS VERY, VERY BRIGHT. I EVEN FOUND A
CHASM, BUT DIDN'T REALLY LIKE THE PLACE, BECAUSE IT WAS, WELL,
BLEAK. I COULD ONLY APPRECIATE THE DISTAN TERRAIN'S WEIRD GLOW.
SERPENS, 6011 787.709
HAH, A GAS GIANT! SO I CAN STILL TRUST MY EYES. IT'S BRIGHT AND
QUITE UNIQUE. MOST OF ITS AMTOSPHERIC FEATURES SEEM TO BLEND INTO
ONE COLOUR, WHICH COMPLETELY ESCAPES MY DESCRIPTIVE ABILITIES.
THE USUAL FEATURES CAN ONLY BARELY BE MADE OUT, BUT THIS DOESN'T
INCLUDE STORMS. AMONG MANY SMALLER ONES, THERE SIT TWO LITERALLY
MONSTROUS TWISTERS, WHICH COULD PROBABLY ENGULF MANY PLANETS THE
SIZE OF FELYSIA. SERPENS, 6011 787.710
SMALL, SOLID, DUSTY, CRATERIZED - SO MUCH FOR THE OFFICIAL
DESCRIPTION, AND IN FACT IT COULD BE ENOUGH. THE GREEN SURFACE
HAS NOTHING SIGNIFICANT ON IT, BARRING ONE FAIRLY LARGE CRATER
WHICH ALOMST RESEMBLES AN EYE IN THESE CONDITIONS, BUT I'D STILL
SOMEWHAT LESS POETICALLY SAY THAT IT'S JUST A LARGE HOLE.
DESCENDING TO THE GROUND DIDN'T REVEAL ANY SUPRISES EITHER, BUT
ADMITTEDLY, I TRIED ONLY ONCE. ONE THING OF NOTE IS THE EXTREME
FROST WHICH I ENCOUNTERED, MUCH DIFFERENT THAN WHAT I FOUND ON
THOSE THICK ATMOSPHERE WORLDS, WHERE RUNAWAY GREENHOUSE EFFECT
ALREADY MADE THE TEMPERATURES RISE ABOVE 60 CELSIUS. ON A SIDE
NOTE, IT'S INTERESTING HOW THE SUBSTELLAR OBJECT'S RELATIVELY
SMALL RING CAN STILL BE CLEARLY SEEN FROM OUT HERE.
SERPENS, 6011 787.710
ANOTHER SMALL AND CRATERIZED MOON, AND I MIGHT EVENTUALLY RUN OUT
OF THINGS TO WRITE ABOUT SUCH OBJECTS, BUT, NO, NOT JUST YET.
ACTUALLY, DESPITE ITS FAIRLY TYPICAL GREEN COLOUR, THIS MOON IS
REMARKABLE. ITS SURFACE SPARKLES, BRINGING SAPPHIRES TO ONE'S
MIND, AND THE 'ARTISTIC' CONTRAST IS NICELY MADE BY NOT ESPECIALLY
NUMEROUS, BUT LARGE AND DARK IMPACT CRATERS STREWN HERE AND THERE.
A GOOD SIGHT FOR THE SORE EYES. SERPENS, 6011 787.710
MEDIUM-SIZED, SOLID, THICK ATMOSPHERE. YET ANOTHER... FIFHT, IF
MY MEMORY IS CORRECT. BUT THIS ONE, AGAIN, IS UNUSUAL. FIRST OF
ALL, I CAN'T DECIDE WHAT WORDS WOULD ADEQUATELY DESCRIBE THIS
WORLD'S ATMOSPHERE. IT'S... GREY, MAYBE, *AND* GREEN, MAYBE, BUT
PERHAPS BOTH, AND PROBABLY SOME OTHER COLOUR, THE NAME OF WHICH
I DON'T KNOW. I BELIEVE IT CAN'T BE PROPERLY DESCRIBED WITH MERE
WORLDS, IT'S JUST VERY STRANGE AND IMPRESSIVE. THIS BEING THE
CASE, I SHOULD STILL MENTION THE PRESENCE OF A NUMBER OF STORMS,
INCLUDING A HUMONGOUS ONE RAGING IN THE SOUTH POLE AREA.
SERPENS, 6011 787.711
AH, YES, THE 'MOON'. NOT ONLY IS IT LARGER, BUT ALSO EXTREMELY
CLOSE! AS MY STARDRIFER WENT ON A HIGH-SPEED ORBIT AROUND THIS
MOON, THE DISTANCE BETWEEN MY STARSHIP AND THE PLANET CONSTANTLY
VARIED. AT ITS CLOSEST, IT WAS ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME AS IF I
WERE ACTUALLY ORBITING THE PLANET! WELL, YOU JUST HAVE TO SEE THIS
WITH YOUR OWN EYES. BESIDES, IT INDEED TURNED OUT TO BE LARGER
(AND SIGNIFICANTLY SO!), BUT THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE REALLY WORTHY
OF NOTICE. OVERALL, I'D BE QUITE TEMPTED TO CALL THIS PAIR A
DOUBLE PLANET. THIS IS DEFINITELY AN OBJECT OF INTEREST, WELL
WORTH A VISIT. YOU WON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. SERPENS, 6011 787.716
MEDIUM-SIZED, ROCKY, CREASED. AN INTERESTING OBJECT, PRIMARILY
DUE TO THE DARK, DUSTY AREAS, WHICH APPEAR TO COVER HALF OF THE
MOON'S SURFACE - OR MORE! THERE ARE ALSO A FEW CRATERS, WHICH ALL
HIDE AMONG THE BLACK SPOTS. AS COULD BE EXPECTED, THE GAS GIANT
IS VERY CLOSE, SO A GREAT PHOTO COMES WITH ALMOST NO EFFORT. AND
IF YOU DECIDE TO LAND HERE, YOU'LL FIND OUT THAT, CONTRARY TO THE
DESCRIPTION, THERE ACTUALLY IS A VERY THIN ATMOSPHERE. MYSELF, I
ALWAYS LIKED TO CLIMB ONE OF THOSE ROUND, FLAT-TOPPED HILLS AND
LOOK BACK AT THE LANDSCAPE LEFT BEHIND. SERPENS, 6011 787.758
SMALL, SOLID, THIN ATMOSPHERE. ITS MOSTLY INCONSPICUOUS, GREENISH
SURFACE HOLDS A FEW BRIGHT SPOTS WHICH SEEM TO BE MORE PROMINENT
THAN ELSEWHERE. I LANDED IN THE CENTRE OF ONE SUCH SPOT, 154.81,
AND THERE WAS A HUGE CRATER, ITS WALLS RISING AROUND ME LIKE A
PRISON. BUT I DID CLIMB THEM AND LOOK DOWN ON MY CAPSULE. THE
CRATER WAS TRULY GREAT, COVERING ABOUT HALF OF THE SECTOR. THE
OTHER HALF, INTERESTINGLY, WAS ALMOST COMPLETELY FLAT. BUT IF
YOU'RE INTERESTED IN LANDSPACES, THIS CRATER WILL BE ENOUGH,
BELIEVE ME. SERPENS, 6011 787.758
SMALL, SOLID, DUSTY, CRATERIZED. GREEN AGAIN, BUT I'M SURE THAT
THEY DO COME IN OTHER COLOURS TOO. THIS ONE IS QUITE REFLECTIVE.
ITS CRATERS ARE EITHER VERY SMALL (AT LEAST IN TWO CASES) OR TOO
OLD TO BE SEEN CLEARLY (ONE SUCH CRATER), BUT IF SO, WHAT
DESTROYED THEM IF THERE'S NO ATMOSPHERE? PERHAPS THE PLANET HAS
A SOMEWHAT LOOSE COMPOSITION... (THE MOON, THAT IS, NOT PLANET)
334.53: DESCENDING WAS A GOOD IDEA, BECAUSE I FOUND A RATHER
SHALLOW, BUT LONG AND TWISTY CHASM-LIKE TERRAIN FEATURE. WELL,
FIRST I FOUND IT, THEN LOST IT, THEN FOUND IT AGAIN, BUT LOST
MYSELF INSTEAD. BUT I AM WRITING THIS DOWN, WHICH IS A PRETTY
GOOD SIGN THAT NOTHING REALLY SERIOUS HAPPENED.
SERPENS, 6011 787.759
MEDIUM-SIZED, QUARTZ SURFACE, OXYGEN ATMOSPHERE. I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO DESCRIBE IT BEST. PINK? GENERALLY, YES, BUT THERE ARE ALSO
MANY SMALL AREAS WHICH APPEAR TO BE DARK GREEN, NOT TO MENTION
ALL THOSE REFLECTIVE SPOTS SHINING WITH INTENSE BRIGHTNESS.
LANDING IN ONE DARK SPOT (10.53) PRODUCED MOUNTAINS, BUT NOT QUITE
AS HIGH OR NUMEROUS (OR DARK!) AS COULD BE EXPECTED. UNWILLING
TO FIGHT THE MOON'S HIGH GRAVITY, I PROMPTLY DEPARTED.
SERPENS, 6011 787.759
MEDIUM-SIZED, SOLID, THICK ATMOSPHERE. AS FAR AS THE BEAUTY OF
SUCH OBJECTS GOES, THIS ONE IS ACTUALLY A SO-SO. ITS CLOUDS ARE
GREY WITH A TINT OF VIOLET AND VERY UNIFORM - ON THE SOUTHERN
HEMISPHERE. TO THE NORTH, ALL SORTS OF USUAL FEATURES START TO
APPEAR, SO WE HAVE TWO DARK, WIDE BELTS AND LARGE STORMS
CONVERGING NEAR THE NORTH POLE. I RISKED LANDING IN ONE SUCH
STORM AND WAS IT DARK DOWN THERE! THE CLOUDS BLOCKED BASICALLY ALL
SUNLIGHT. I WERE LUCKY I COULD SEE MY CUPOLA GLITTER SLIGHTLY
AFTER CARELESSLY MOVING AWAY FROM IT. SERPENS, 6011 787.760
MEDIUM-SIZED AND INTERNALLY HOT. NO LANDING HERE, OBVIOUSLY - I
DON'T WANT TO BE A BAKED CAT, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE EVEN FROM ORBIT
IT'S A TRUE INFERNO. A TREMENDOUS VOLCANO DOMINATES HERE (SEEN
CLOSE TO THE TERMINATOR CURRENTLY), AND MANY BRIGHT SEAS OF
MOLTEN MATERIAL DOT THE REMAINING AREA ALL AROUND THE VISIBLE
HEMISPHERE. AMONG THEM ARE MANY DARKER AREAS WHICH COULD BE
MOUNTAIN RANGES, OR HUMONGOUS CHASMS. THERE'S NO TELLING IN THIS
CASE. SERPENS, 6011 787.760
MEDIUM-SIZED, SOLID, THICK ATMOSPHERE. GREEN AND, ON THE FIRST
IMPRESSION, SOMEWHAT UNIFORM. IT WAS ENOUGH TO WAIT A WHILE,
HOWEVER, TO SEE THAT ALL THE STORMS - WHICH ARE INDEED LARGE! -
ARE GATHERED ON ONE HALF OF THE PLANET, SPARING THE OTHER ONE
FROM THEIR RAGE. IT MIGHT ALSO BE WORTH TO NOTE THAT A BELT OF
LOWER CLOUD THICKNESS APPEARS TO BE FORMING TO THE NORTH, BUT IT'S
STILL SMALL AND LARGELY DISRUPTED. LANDING THERE CONFIRMED MY
SUSPICIONS, EVEN THOUGH THE PRESSURE IS NOT YET AS LOW AS IN
SIMILAR, BUT MORE DEFINED STRUCTURES ON OTHER WORLDS.
SERPENS, 6011 787.760
THIS IS THE LARGE MOON I MENTIONED, THOUGH THIS TIME IT'S
CERTAINLY NOT LARGER THAN THE PRIMARY. MEDIUM-SIZED AND INTERNALLY
HOT, MASSIVE VOLCANOES STAND OUT ON THE SURFACE, EXTREMELY LARGE
GROUPS OF WHICH METODICALLY RUIN HUGE AREAS OF TERRAIN. THEY CAN
ALSO BE SPOTTED ON THE NIGHTSIDE EASILY. AND THE PRIMARY IS VERY
CLOSE, WITH ITS RING VISIBLE FAR BETTER FROM HERE.
SERPENS, 6011 787.761
SMALL, SOLID, THIN ATMOSPHERE, I WAS ACUTALLY SUPRISED TO SEE
THIS HERE, BECAUSE SUCH OBJECTS CAN GROW TO REALLY LARGE SIZES.
IT'S GREENISH (ACK!), BUT BRIGHT FEATURES CAN BE SEEN ON THE
SURFACE AND THEY CLEARLY ARE LARGE CRATERS. THEY RARELY ARE SO
NOTICEABLE. UPON LANDING, SOMEWHAT SMALLER SIGNS OF COSMIC
BOMBARDMENT CAN BE FOUND, AND IF YOU REFUSE TO LOOK FOR THEM, YOU
CAN ALWAYS WATCH THE SUPRISINGLY SPECTACULAR TERRAIN AND SERENE,
DARK VIOLET SKY. SERPENS, 6011 787.762
SMALL, SOLID, DUSTY - FINALLY, BECAUSE I EXPECTED ALL THREE MOONS
TO BE OF SUCH TYPE. IT ALSO FINALLY ISN'T GREEN! I'D DESCRIBE IT
AS GREY WITH MANY PURPLE (BUT VERY PALE) INFLUENCES. SOME SMALL
BRIGHTER SPOTS CAN ALSO BE MADE OUT, AND SPARSE BUT PROMINENT
CRATERS REMIND OF THIS MOON'S UNEASY PAST. LANDING AT 37.60,
A CRATER-LIKE STRUCTURE STANDS OUT TO THE SOUTH-EAST, BUT IT'S
REALLY A LARGER SLOPE, AND THE SECTOR SOON ENDS WITH RUGGED SPIKES.
SERPENS, 6011 787.762
THE FIRST MOON. SMALL, SOLID, DUSTY, CRATERIZED... OH, AND GREEN.
THE SURFACE IS BLEAK AND ITS ONLY FEATURES ARE CRATERS, WHICH
ARE LARGE AND NUMEROUS. WELL, THERE'S NOT MUCH TO SAY ABOUT ITS
SURFACE AS SEEN FROM OUTER SPACE. I LANDED AT 73.60, WHICH WAS
O A CRATER'S RIM AND THERE WERE ACTUALLY THREE SMALLER CRATERS,
BUT NOTHING UNUSUAL. IN MY FIRST ATTEMPT, THOUGH, THE CAPSULE
SIMPLY DIDN'T LET ME OUT! MUST HAVE BEEN THE SLOPE'S ANGLE,
BECAUSE IN MY SECOND TRY, I 'FIXED' THE SITUATION BY PUSHING THE
CAPSULE TO THE SOUTH WHILE STILL DESCENDING. SERPENS, 6011 787.774
THE SECOND MOON OF THE SMALL AND CRATERIZED SORT. IT'S YELLOWISH,
BUT NOT WITHOUT PLAINLY GREY AREAS HERE AND THERE. A MASSIVE
AREA OF ITS SURFACE, CONCENTRATED AROUND SEVERAL LARGE IMPACT
CRATERS, IS EXTREMELY REFLECTIVE, HIGHLY STANDING OUT. IT'S
INTERESTING, BEACUSE THERE ARE OTHER LARGE CRATERS WITH EJECTA
RAYS WHICH LACK THIS PARTICULAR FEATURE. LANDING IN A BRIGHT SPOT
REVEALED VERY FLAT TERRAIN ALL AROUND, WHICH SOMEWHAT EXPLAINS
THE REFLECTIVITY, BUT NOT WHY IT'S CONCENTRATED IN ONE PLACE ONLY.
SERPENS, 6011 787.775
SMALL, SOLID, DUSTY, AS COULD BE EXPECTED. OF COURSE, IT'S ALSO
GREEN AND BLEAK, WHICH MAKES ITS SIGHT RATHER UNINTERESTING TO
THE EYE... AT LEAST BY AESTHETICAL STANDARDS. SEVERAL SMALL
CRATERS ARE STREWN AROUND, AS ARE A FEW MEDIUM-SIZED ONES. THE
DEFAULT LANDING SPOT (0.60, THAT IS) OFFERS A RATHER SMALL CHASM,
WHICH CAN BE SPOTTED TO THE WEST BY A CAREFUL ENOUGH OBSERVER,
AND A MUCH LARGER CRATER, IMMEDIATELY VISIBLE UPON DESCENT.
SERPENS, 6011 787.775
A MOON. SMALL, SOLID, THIN ATMOSPHERE. THIS IS WHERE THEY GET,
WELL, SIMILAR TO THEMSELVES. NAMELY, VERY DARK... VERY DARK
GREEN, TO BE EXACT. THERE'S ALSO AT LEAST ONE BRIGHTER SPOT,
DEFINITELY A SOMEWHAT LARGE CRATER. HOWEVER, ON THE SURFACE, IT
WAS NOTHING LIKE BRIGHT EVEN THERE. I COULD BARELY SEE ANYTHING
EXCEPT FOR MY CUPOLA'S GLITTERING, AND AFTER MY EYES ADAPTED, I
SAW THAT THE WHOLE AREA IS SIMPLY FLAT. I COULD WALK AWAY AND
STILL CLEARLY SEE MY LANDER, DESPITE ALL THE DARKNESS. THE SKY
HAD A VERY DARK BROWN COLOUR. OVERALL, IT WAS AN EERIE PLACE AND
PERHAPS I'D LAND AGAIN IF I STUMBLED UPON THIS VERY MOON IN THE
FUTURE. SERPENS, 6011 787.969
A MOON. SMALL, SOLID, DUSTY, CRATERIZED. SUPRISE, EH? BUT REALLY
SUPRISING - IT'S NOT GREEN! INSTEAD, THE SURFACE IS PINK, MANY
SHADES TOO. ALSO MANY CRATERS OF VARYING SIZE AND DISTRIBUTED
HIGHLY IRREGULARLY - THERE ARE VERY HUGE AREAS WHEN ALMOST
NOTHING IS PRESENT, AND SOME WHERE MOST OF THE SPACE IS COVERED
BY IMPACT REMNANTS. AT 0.59, A BEAUTIFUL, DEEP REDDISH COLOUR
OF THE GROUND IMMEDIATELY CATCHES ONE'S EYE. THERE'S INTERESTING
TERRAIN TO THE EAST, AND THE WHOLE MOON SEEMS TO BE SIMPLY
ATTRACTIVE. PERHAPS IT'S WORTH TO MAKE SOME FURTHER EXPLORATION.
SERPENS, 6011 787.969
THE FIRST MOON. SMALL, SOLID, DUSTY ETC. IT'S DIFFICULT TO
DESCRIBE ITS COLOUR... MAYBE A MIX OF BROWN AND YELLOW, SOMEWHAT
BLEAK. THERE'S AT LEAST ONE EXTREMELY HUGE CRATER, ONE VERY
LARGE, AND A GOOD NUMBER OF SMALLER ONES. LANDED AT 11.57, AND
THE FIRST THING WHICH I NOTED WAS THE EXTREMELY LOW GRAVITY -
0.115 FG! OF COURSE LANDING WAS SLOW, BUT THE GRAVITY ALSO
ALLOWED FOR EASY MOVEMENT AND VEEERY LONG JUMPS. A CRATER NOT TOO
FAR TO THE NORTH HELPED WITH JUMPING. SERPENS, 6011 788.36
SECOND MOON... MEDIUM-SIZED, INTERNALLY HOT. ITS DARK APPEARANCE,
WITHOUT DOUBT CAUSED BY THE GREAT DISTANCE FROM THE STAR, GIVES
IT A MORE INFERNAL LOOK THAN IT PERHAPS WOULD NORMALLY HAVE.
THERE ARE SOME VERY LARGE VOLCANOES AND A FEW BODIES OF LAVA-LIKE
SUBSTANCE, BUT OTHER THAN THAT, THE SURFACE IS NOT TOO DESTROYED
(YET). STILL, LANDING IS NOT POSSIBLE. SERPENS, 6011 788.37
THE FIRST MOON, SMALL, SOLID, DUSTY... AS EXPECTED, THE PLANET
WITH ITS RING IS CLEARLY SEEN HERE, BUT THE RING IS CERTAINLY
LESS SPECTACULAR THAN IF IT WERE TILTED AT SOME ANGLE. STILL,
THE PHOTOGRAPHIC OPPORTUNITY CAN'T BE MISSED. AS FOR THE MOON
ITSELF, IT IS OF COURSE GREEN, SLIGHTLY VARIED IN BRIGHTNESS,
AND HAS NUMEROUS CRATERS OF DIFFERENT SIZES WHICH ARE VERY DARK.
THIS GIVES THEM A STRONG SENSE OF DEPTH, ALMOST AS IF THEY WERE
TO EJECT THEMSELVES FROM THE SURFACE. THE EFFECT IS HIGHLY
IMPRESSIVE AND SIMPLY MAKES YOU TO TAKE ANOTHER AND ANOTHER LOOK,
AND IT'S DIFFICULT TO STOP. SERPENS, 6011 788.55
AH, THE SECOND MOON, WHICH I MANAGED TO MISS DURING THE INITIAL
APPROACH. VERY INTERESTING. AGAIN SMALL, SOLID, DUSTY, BUT IN
REALITY, IT'S DIFFICULT TO DESCRIBE ITS APPEARANCE. SAYING SIMPLY
'BROWNISH' WOULD DO NO JUSTICE TO REFLECTIVE AREAS OF EJECTA
STREAKS SURROUNDING SOME LARGE CRATERS. 'UNIFORM' WOULD BE THE
WORST WAY TO CALL THIS MOON. AND ALSO, IT'S WORTH TO NOTE HOW
ITS PLANET LOOKS FROM HERE, OR RATHER, HOW IT'S BASICALLY
INVISIBLE, LEAVING ONLY THE RING'S THIN, BRIGHT LINE TO BEHOLD.
SERPENS, 6011 788.55
FIRST MOON... SMALL, SOLID, DUSTY, CRATERIZED. GREEN SURFACE,
SOMEWHAT BRIGHT FOR THIS DISTANCE, THOUGH OF COURSE IT'S ALSO
BLEAK. STILL, THE REFLECTIVITY MUST BE HIGH. FOUR HUMONGOUS
CRATERS DOMINATE THE CURRENTLY VISIBLE HEMISPHERE, WITH A SMALLER
ONE AND SOME VERY TINY ONES HIDING AMONG THEM. I DID TRY TO
DESCEND, AT 14.60, AND IT WAS JUST AS DARK AS IT SHOULD BE. A
CRATER STANDS RIGHT NEXT TO THE LANDING SPOT. ONE THING OF NOTE -
THE EDGES OF DISTANT TERRAIN GLOWED AMAZINGLY, CREATING A
STRIKING CONTRAST WITH THE GENERALLY VERY DARK ENVIROMNENT.
SERPENS, 6011 788.118
AND THIS IS THE SECOND MOON... OF THE SAME TYPE, BUT HIGHLY
DIFFERENT THAN THE FIRST ONE. NAMELY, IT ISN'T GREEN! A PLEASANT,
BROWNISH HUE MAKES ITS DISK A RELIEF TO THE EYE. IT ALSO APPEARS
TO BE A BIT MORE UNIFORM THAN THE FIRST MOON, IF YOU DON'T COUNT
CRATERS. THESE ARE GENERALLY SMALLER, BUT ALSO MORE NUMEROUS AND
DEFINED. RAYS OF EJECTED MATTER ARE PERFECTLY VISIBLE. LANDING
DIDN'T BRING ANY SPECTACULAR SUPRISES THOUGH, AND I'M MOVING ON
TO PLANET 16, SO NO FURTHER TRIES HERE. SERPENS, 6011 788.119
YES, I IMMEDIATELY WENT TO THE WINDOW TOO SEE THE SUBSTELLAR
OBJECT. A TRULY IMPRESSIVE SIGHT, ITS RING IS SEEN IN ALL ITS
GLORY, SIMPLY MAGNIFICENT. AS FOR THE MOON ITSELF, IT'S
MEDIUM-SIZED, QUARTZ. COLOURED BROWN, MOSTLY VERY DARK, WITH
THE OBLIGATORY REFLECTIVE SPOTS STREWN HERE AND THERE, BUT EVEN
THEY AREN'T TOO BRIGHT. NO WONDER AT THIS DISTANCE, THOUGH.
SERPENS, 6011 788.129
ANOTHER MOON - SMALL, SOLID, ICY. ALREADY SOMEWHAT FAR FROM THE
SUBSTELLAR OBJECT, SO IT AND ITS RING DON'T LOOK SO SPECTACULAR
FROM HERE. THE MOON ITSELF IS DARK BROWN WITH A SLIGHT REDDISH
TINT AND ITS SURFACE IS LARGELY UNIFORM. THERE ARE SOME BRIGHTER
AND DARKER AREAS, OF COURSE, BUT BARELY DISCERNABLE. SURFACE
CRACKS ARE FEW AND ALMOST IVISIBLE. SERPENS, 6011 788.145
THE THIRD MOON. SMALL, SOLID, ICY SURFACE... LOOKS INTERESTING.
IT'S QUITE SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ONE, BUT HAS FAR MORE STREAKS
AND BRIGHTNESS VARIETY. THERE'S EVEN SOMETHING SLIGHTLY
RESEMBLING A CRATER. SERPENS, 6011 788.146
FOURTH MOON, AGAIN SMALL, SOLID, ICY, THIS ONE IS SUPRISINGLY
BEAUTIFUL. BEING VIOLET IN APPEARANCE, IT ALSO HAS MANY BRIGHTER
STREAKS CUTTING THROUGH ITS SURFACE. BUT THE VIOLET COLOUR MAKES
A STRONG IMPRESSION OF CALMNESS. THE SIGHT IS ALMOST SERENE.
SERPENS, 6011 788.146
FIFTH MOON, AGAIN SMALL, SOLID, ICY, AND AGAIN A SPLENDID WORLD.
AESTHETICALLY, AT LEAST. IT LOOKS MORE LIKE DARK UNSTABLE OR
THIN ATMOSPHERE WORLDS WITH ITS DARK BROWN APPEARANCE, MANY
CONTRASTING BRIGHT AREAS AND PITCH BLACK CRACKS WHICH MAKE THE
SIGHT EVEN MORE DRAMATIC. IT'S ALMOST INFERNAL, EVEN THOUGH THE
PLACE IS IN FACT AN ICEBALL. SERPENS, 6011 788.146
YET AONTHER GIANT BALL OF ICE... IT'S VERY PRETTY BECAUSE OF ITS
STRIKING, EXTREME SIMILARITY TO NO. 17.5. PERHAPS IT'S NOT SO
DARK, AND THUS SLIGHTLY LESS DRAMATIC, BUT GENERALLY, THEY SHARE
ALL THE GENERAL FEATURES. VERY INTERESTING. SERPENS, 6011 788.146
ANOTHER MOON OF THE SAME TYPE. IT'S A BIT WEIRD, THE SURFACE
COLOUR BEING A MIX OF RED AND ORANGE, AND IF MY ONBOARD SYSTEMS
DIDN'T KNOW BETTER, JUDGING BY THE LOOKS THEMSELVES, I'D SWEAR
THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THOSE DUSTY AND CRATERIZED MOONLETS.
THE USUAL STREAKS ARE SO OVERWHELMING HERE THAT THEY CREATE AN
IMPRESSION OF CRATERS WHEN MIXED WITH 'NORMAL' AREAS.
SERPENS, 6011 788.146
ANOTHER MOON OF THE SAME CLASS, AND THERE ARE AT LEAST FIVE MORE,
BUT THEY STILL DON'T GET BORING. THIS SATELLITE LOOKS ACTUALLY
FAR MORE LIKE A THIN ATMOSPHERE (OR *THICK* ATMOSPHERE) WORLD
WITH ITS DEEP GREEN COLOUR, A SOMEWHAT SMOOTH MIX OF DARK
(MOSTLY) AND BRIGHTER AREAS, AND VERY FEW STREAKS.
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO LAND EVEN HERE. SERPENS, 6011 788.146
YES, AGAIN SMALL, SOLID, ICY, AND AGAIN SOMEWHAT UNIQUE. I THINK
THAT ALL ARE UNIQUE IN THIS PLACE. THIS TIME, I'M REALLY UNABLE
TO DESCRIBE ITS APPEARANCE APPROPRIATELY. THE SIMPLEST WAY, WHICH
WOULD BE 'A MIXTURE OF GREEN AND PINK', IS AWFULLY INADEQUATE.
SERPENS, 6011 788.147
OH YES, MOVING FURTHER AND ENCOUNTERING MOVE AMAZING WORLDS WITH
EVERY SINGLE STEP. I'M OUT OF WORDS AGAIN, THIS ICY MOON IS
INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL AND PURELY ONE-OF-A-KIND. I'M NOT EVEN
GOING TO TRY COMING UP WITH A DESCRIPTION. SERPENS, 6011 788.147
SMALL, SOLID, ICY, BUT IT'S YET ANOTHER DIFFICULT TO DESCRIBE
OBJECT. IT ACTUALLY APPEARS ALMOST COMPLETELY UNIFORM, BUT AT
THE SAME TIME, ONE JUST KNOWS THAT IT ISN'T TRUE. THE STREAKS
ARE SO PROMINENT AND NUMEROUS THAT THEY COVER MOST OF THE
SURFACE, MAKING OTHER FEATURES OBSCURE. SERPENS, 6011 788.147
WELL, MAYBE THERE'S NO FELISIAN MOON HERE AFTER ALL. THIS ONE
IS AGAIN ICY, AND GREEN, BUT WHAT KIND OF GREEN! THE MAGNIFICENT
MIX OF DIFFERENT SHADES MAKES THIS GLOBE LOOK LIKE, I DON'T
KNOW... A DARKENED SAPPHIRE. I'M SO GLAD THAT I CAME HERE.
SERPENS, 6011 788.147
PERHAPS THE LAST MOON OF THIS SUBSTELLAR OBJECT (I'M NOT SURE)
AND PROBABLY THE DARKEST. OF COURSE ICY, IT'S VERY DIM BROWN,
ALMOST BLACK, AND SEEMS TO PLAY TRICKS WITH YOUR EYES... WELL,
FOR SOME REASON IT'S ALMOST UNREAL. BUT MAYBE THIS IS JUST MY
IMPRESSION. SERPENS, 6011 788.147
SO 17.13 WAS NOT THE LAST MOON AFTER ALL. THIS ONE, YET ANOTHER
ICY WORLD, IS MUCH LIKE THE ONE I DESCRIBED AS 'DARKENED
SAPPHIRE', ONLY WITH ABOUT TWICE AS MUCH SURFACE CRACKS. THE
RESULT IS PERHAPS EVEN MORE BIZARRE, BUT NOT AS STRIKING.

THE CRATERS LEAD ME TO BELIEVE THAT A BATTLE TOOK PLACE HERE.
FOUND SOMETHING INTERESTING. THERE ARE SMALL PYRAMIDS EVERYWHERE
ON THE SURFACE OF THIS PLANET. MUST CHECK TO SEE IF THIS IS A PHENOM-
ENON THAT IS SYSTEM-WIDE. DIDN'T EXPLORE TOO MUCH AS THERE IS VERY
LITTLE LIGHT.
FOUND HIGH, APPARENTLY CAT-MADE HILLS AND SMALL PYRAMIDS EVERYWHERE.
THE PLANET HAS YELLOW GRASS AND LIFE IN THE FORM OF HOPPERS AND
BIRDS. THERE WAS AN INTERESTING PHENOMENON WHEN I REACHED

GOING ANY FURTHER. I INTEND TO RETURN TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FORCE
FIELD AND SEE IF IT IS THE SAME ON THE REVERSE SIDE.

REFLECTIVE ICE AND CAN'T MAKE OUT ANY DETAILS. SLOWLY, SOME HILLS OF
ICE START TO APPEAR, ALMOST COMPLETELY TRANSPARENT. WHEN YOU COME
CLOSE TO THE GROUND, YOU REALIZE THAT IT'S A WHOLE MOUNTAIN. BEHIND
YOU IS AN ISLAND. THE CAPSULE TOUCHES DOWN AND YOU EMERGE OUT OF IT.
SUDDENLY, EVERYTHING BECOMES SO BRIGHT THAT YOU MUST CLOSE YOUR
EYES. WHEN YOU CAN OPEN THEM AGAIN, YOU REALIZE THAT YOU'RE STANDING
ON THE SIDE OF LARGE ICEBERG. EVERYTHING AROUND YOU IS WHITE FROM
SUNLIGHT, BUT YOU CAN BARELY MAKE OUT ANOTHER ICY ISLAND BEHIND YOU.

WALKING OUT ON THE SURFACE AND THEN LOOKING INTO THE DARK SKY
ONE CAN SEE THE MULTITUDE OF STARS THERE AND WONDER
WHERE IN THIS VAST UNIVERSE IS HOME....

FIRST PLANET ORBITING EKA55. CRATERED. GREEN-GREY. --EKA
THIS THIN-ATMOSPHERE DARK BLUE PLANET ORBITING THE BLUE GIANT EKA55
IS AS CLOSE TO A STAR'S SHADOW AS ONE COULD IMAGINE. --EKA
THIS GAS GIANT ORBITING EKA40 IS THE FIRST PLANET FROM THE SUN.
IT LOOKS LIKE CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM WITH AREAS OF MINT. IT ALSO
HAS A DECENT RING FORMATION; CHOCOLATE CHUNKS. OVERALL A
DELICIOUS AND BEAUTIFUL PLANET. --EKA
BEAUTIFUL  GREEN CRATERED PLANET ON EKA40! ONE OF THE BEST CRATERED
ONES I'VE SEEN, ALONG WITH 'ANCIENT ATTEMPT', WHICH IS IN THE SAME
SYSTEM. SIMPLY WONDERFUL PLANET, DEFINITELY WORTH A VISIT TO ADMIRE.
--EKA
WHITE QUARTZ MOON ON EKA40 WITH WHITE SPOTS. IT LOOKS LIKE
A LAYERED JAWBREAKER AFTER A FEW MINUTES OF LICKING. ALSO
HAS AN UNUSUALLY LARGE NUMBER OF MOONS FOR A QUARTZ PLANET.

NOW THAT I THINK OF IT, THE MOONS ARE INCREDIBLY CLOSE IN.

BLUE FELISIAN MOON OF MINISTAR 'HOT OVEN' ON EKA40. I'M GOING TO
GO VISIT IT NOW. --EKA
UPON LANDING ON 295-29, I FOUND A LANDSCAPE WITH SMALL HILLS AND
A BIRD OR TWO FLYING AROUND, THOUGH IT DIDN'T SEEM TO HAVE ANY
LAKES OR NOTICABLE PLANT LIFE. I'M GOING TO GO VISIT ANOTHER
AREA NOW. --EKA
UPON LANDING ON 264-60, I AGAIN FOUND A HILLY AREA WITH NO WATER
OR LAND LIFE, THOUGH AGAIN THERE WERE SOME BIRDS. I'M GOING TO
ENTER A STORMIER AREA NOW TO CHECK FOR WATER AND GREENERY. --EKA
LANDED ON 328-67 ON AN ARC OF ONE OF THE STORMS, NOT WANTING TO
LAND IN THE VERY MIDDLE. THOUGHT I SAW SOME WATER AS I WAS
DESCENDING BUT UPON INSPECTION I ONLY FOUND SOME HIGHER HILLS AND
DEEPER VALLEYS, THOUGH THEY WERE STILL INSIGNIFICANT. SAW ANOTHER
BIRD AND A HOPPING LAND CREATURE. STILL NO GREENERY. I'M GOING TO
LAND IN A STORM. --EKA
LANDED IN 306-66 IN THE CENTER OF A LIGHTNING STORM. AGAIN, AS
I DESCENDED I THOUGHT I SAW A LAKE BUT I COULDN'T FIND IT UPON
LANDING; IT WAS EITHER A VALLEY OR A MIRAGE. I'VE GIVEN UP ON
THE PROSPECT OF WATER BODIES ON THIS PLANET.. WELL, MOON. --EKA

THIS GREY, HIGH-CONTRASTING CRATERED MOON OF 'HOT OVEN' ON
EKA40 LOOKS RATHER LIKE A TWO-YEAR-OLD COOKING ATTEMPT THAT
WAS NEVER THROWN OUT. AFTER THE ORIGINAL IMPULSE TO CALL IT
A SKULL BECAUSE IT LOOKS MORE LIKE THAT I DECIDED TO GO WITH
THIS NAME SINCE I'M STICKING WITH A THEME. THIS MOON IS
ACTUALLY VERY BEAUTIFUL. IT IS ONE OF THE BEST CRATERED MOONS
I'VE YET SEEN. WORTH A VISIT! --EKA
THIS STAR SEEMS TO HAVE SOME TASTE, AFTER ALL, HEHE. MANY OF
THE OTHER PLANETS LOOKED LIKE JUNK FOOD BUT THIS ONE AS WELL
AS SOME OTHERS ORBITING THE MINISTAR 'HOT OVEN' (ACTUALLY,
(THIS ONE IS A MOON) ARE MUCH MORE VEGETABLE-BASED. ANYHOO,
THIS IS A CRATERED OLIVE-GREEN MOON. NOT TOO BAD. --EKA
I WAS AMAZED WHEN THE NAMES BUBBLE GUM, TAFFY, AND COTTON
CANDY WERE ALL TAKEN FOR THIS MOON. ANYWAY, IT ORBITS 'HOT

SERPENS, 6011 665.407
YET ANOTHER DEAD WORLD WITH NO ATMOSPHERE. SERPENS, 6011 665.407
FINALLY A FELISIAN PLANET. THERE SEEMS TO BE NOT MUCH WATER, BUT I'LL
CHECK OUT. ALSO HAS THREE MOONS.
33.50 - THE GROUND IS FROZEN AND HILLY. TEMP. -55 CELSIUS. I'VE STILL
SPOTTED A FEW BIRDS AND A HOPPER. NO PLANT LIFE, THOUGH.
29.60 - TEMP. +10 CELSIUS. NICE BAY, AND ORDINARY - BUT SOMEWHAT SPARSE
- EQUATORIAL PLANT LIFE. SERPENS, 6011 665.407
MEDIUM-SIZED, SOLID, THICK ATMOSPHERE. SMOOTH CLOUD COVER WITH SOME

CORRECTION: SERPENS, 6011 665.410
THIS MOON ACTUALLY HAS NO ATMOSPHERE, AND ITS SURFACE IS FROZEN!
IMPOSSIBLE! ;) SERPENS, 6011 665.410
FROZEN SOLID, BUT VERY DIFFRENT FROM REGULAR ICEBALLS. IT'S SURFACE
IS PERFECTLY SMOOTH AND EXTREMELY REFLECTIVE. THE RESULTING, ALMOST
PURELY WHITE COLOUR RESEMBLES A SUBSTELLAR GIANT VERY FAR FROM ITS
MAIN STAR... SERPENS, 6011 665.410
THE VERY LAST BODY OF THIS SYSTEM. ITS ICY SURFACE IS PROBABLY
COVERED BY A LAYER OF DUST. SERPENS, 6011 665.410
THE FIRST OF THE 2 FELISIAN PLANETS THAT I DISCOVERE IN THIS SYSTEM. IS
QUITE DRY AND HAS SOMEWHAT LOW AIR PRESSURE. (NOTES BY SERAXIS)
THE SECOND FELISIAN PLANET I DISCOVERED IN THE FALCONIS SYSTEM. THIS
PLANET NEARLY COMPLETELY COVERED WITH WATER. THE POLAR OPPOSITE TO THE
OTHER FELISIAN PLANET IN THIS SYSTEM. (NOTES BY SERAXIS)
I FOUND A MASSIVE CANYON AT 139:49. IT'S WALLS APPEAR TO BE COATED WITH
CRYSTAL. (NOTES BY SERAXIS)

BY PARSIS, WHAT KIND OF IDIOT I WAS TO FLY ALMOST 900 DYAMS ONLY TO
SEE THIS PIECE OF ROCK? WELL, MAYBE I'M AN EXPLORER :). BUT PREFERABLY
JUST IDIOT. SERPENS, 6011 665.618
THIS SMALL, CRATERIZED BODY RESEMBLES A... MOULDED WATERMELON (WITH
THE CRATERS BEING SPOTS OF MOULD). SERPENS, 6011 665.619
MEDIUM-SIZED, THICK ATMOSPHERE, COVERED WITH CLOUDS, NUMEROUS, HUGE
STORMS NOTICED. THE PLANET ALSO POSSESSES A NICE, REFLECTIVE RING.
SERPENS, 6011 665.619
THE DISTANCES ARE GETTING LARGER. HERE, I'VE WASTED LITHIUM FOR AN
1500-DYAM JOURNEY TO TAKE A LOOK AT ORDINARY BALL OF ICE. MAYBE ITS
MOONS WILL PROVE INTERESTING, BUT CHANCES ARE VANISHINGLY SMALL.
SERPENS, 6011 665.620
ON QUARTZ PLANETS, THERE'S USUALLY VERY BRIGHT ON THE SURFACE, NO
MATTER WHAT. THIS ONE'S NOT EXCEPTIONAL. SERPENS, 6011 665.621
AT THIS POINT AND THOSE DISTANCES, I COULD COMPLETELY IGNORE THE
PLANETS AND JUST WRITE NOTES ACCORDING TO DESCRIPTIONS, BUT I'M STILL
WILLING TO VISIT ALL THOSE BODIES (AND WASTE LITHIUM ON THOUSAND-DYAM
FLIGHTS). SO, THIS PLANET HAS QUITE DARK SURFACE WIT NO NOTABLE
CRATERS, A NICE - THOUGH QUITE DARK - RING AND ONE MOON. SERPENS, 6011
665.622
I'M NOW STARTING THE 4600-DYAM FLIGHT TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS SYSTEM
- PROBABLY ONLY TO SEE A COMPLETELY DARK WORLD WITH THIN ATMOSPHERE -
AND THERE ARE STILL TWO PLANETS REMAINING, IF MY MEMORY DOESN'T FAIL
ME. I WON'T GIVE UP. SERPENS, 6011 665.622
THE PLANET TURNED OUT TO BE EXACTLY THE SAME WITH WHAT I PREDICTED:
DARK, DARK AND DARK. SERPENS, 6011 665.623
ANOTHER FARWORLD, BUT THIS TIME I MANAGED TO CUT THE DISTANCE FROM
5500 DYAMS TO 2900 BY COMING CLOSE TO GOAT STAR USING VIMANA DRIVE.
SUCH A DISTANCE SHORTENING WASN'T POSSIBLE FOR GOAT 16, SADLY. SERPENS
, 6011 665.623
A QUARTZ PLANET WITH OXYGEN ATMOSPHERE, PRETTY TERRAIN FEATURES AND
VERY BRIGHT DAYTIME - EVEN AT 3000 DYAMS AWAY FROM THE STAR. SERPENS,
6011 665.624
GOAT 18 IS A LARGE, NON CONSISTENT PLANET, AND THE 9000-DYAM FLIGHT IS
NOW BEGINNING. THANKFULLY, IT SEEMS THAT GOAT 18 DOESN'T HAVE AS MANY
MOONS AS ITS CATALOGUE NUMBER WOULD TELL :) SERPENS, 6011 665.625
TURNS OUT THAT THIS PLANET DOESN'T HAVE A MOON - IT HAS THREE... OH,
WELL. IT ALSO HAS A HUGE RING AND VERY DARK SURFACE. SERPENS, 6011 665

WELL! A VERY INTERESTING MOON! ACCORDING TO THE DESCRIPTION, IT'S
JUST ONE OF THOSE DEAD, CREASED MOONS, BUT FROM ORBIT... THE SURFACE

SPOTS OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN. THIS DESCRIPTION MAY NOT SOUND TOO GOOD, BUT
GIVE IT A TRY - THE PLANET IS WONDERFUL... SERPENS, 6011 665.608

MEDIUM-SIZED, THICK ATMOSPHERE. UNINTERESTING. SERPENS, 6011 665.615
THE SIXTEENTH - AND LAST - MOON OF GOAT 5. HAS SOME BIG CRATERS.
SERPENS, 6011 665.615
IT'S A WONDER THAT THIS MOON STILL EXISTS - ABOUT 50 PERCENT OF ITS

ALMOST PUPRLE ICEBALL WITH MANY SURFACE CRACKS. SERPENS, 6011 665.617

SMALL. CRATERIZED. TYPICAL. BORING. SERPENS, 6011 665.621

FELISIAN PLANET,IT HAS MANY SMALL BODIES OF WATER ON IT'S SURFACE
I SAW MANY VARITIES OF ANIMAL LIFE ON THIS PLANET
DISCOVERED BY KJ EPOC 6011:576.445
THIS PLANET IS VERY FLAT IN GEOGRAPHY
THE POLAR ICE CAPS WERE DEVOID OF LIFE
BARREN, YET THINGS STILL SURVIVE
FELISIAN PLANET. A LONE, PYRAMIDAL ISLAND CAN BE SEEN FROM 73.89:-50.9
ARCHIPELAGO AT 31.119. IT IS A GOOD PLACE FOR TAKING SOME PHOTOGRAPHS.
A NICE VALLEY AT 86.53
WHILE EXPLORING, I FELL INTO A CANYON AT 91.60:46.29. BECAUSE OF THE
THICK ATMOSPHERE, I DIDN'T NOTICE IT IN TIME. SO BE CAREFUL.

ALTHOUGH I DID LAND IN A STRANGE VALLEY THAT LOOKED ALMOST MAN-MADE
PROBABLY NOTHING, THERE WERE NO OTHER SIGNS OF CIVILISATION
THERE IS ONE LONE MOON CIRCLING THIS PLANET (PATO)

THE SURFACE IS MOSTLY QUARTZ OF LITTLE INTEREST
THERE ARE SMALL BLACK AREAS VISIBLE FROM SPACE HOWEVER
I RECOMMEND VISITING ONE OF THESE AREAS, AS ON THE SURFACE THERE ARE...
MANY TOWERING PEAKS ALL CLOSE TOGETHER, THE HIGHEST ONES I'VE EVER SEEN
THERE IS ONE ORBITING SATELLITE, CALLED RUNNIDEV

ON THE SURFACE THERE ARE MANY HILLS AND VALLEYS
THE ONLY MOON OF THE PLANET AERSI
SMALL AND WITH NO ATMOSPHERE, AND MANY LARGE CRATERS
MEDIUM-SIZED, ROCKY, CREASED. THE PLANET IS RINGED, BUT ITS RING,
WHILE RATHER LARGE, IS ALSO QUITE DARK AND BEST SEEN AGAINST THE
STAR. TWO OTHER PLANETS COULD BE ALSO SEEN FROM HERE. FURTHERMORE,
UPON LANDING, IT TURNED OUT THAT THE PLANET'S (RATHER HOT) SURFACE
IS ACTUALLY TRANSPARENT! SERPENS, 6011 787.588
SMALL, SOLID, THIN AMOSPHERE. FAIRLY BRIGHT SURFACE, GREY WITH A
GREENISH TINT. DOWN THERE, IT'S ACTUALLY NOT THAT DARK.
SERPENS, 6011 787.588
SMALL, SOLID, THIN ATMOSPHERE. PROBABLY SOMETHING PREVENTED THIS
ONE FROM BECOMING FELYSIAN. AGAIN QUITE BRIGHT, AND YOU CAN
EXPECT THE USUAL CALM LANDSPACE UPON LANDING, ALTHOUGH IT'S
SOMEWHAT BLEAK HERE. THE PLANET HAS TWO MOONS, ONE OF WHICH IS
VERY LARGE AND NEARBY, WHICH CREATES A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO
PRACTICE PHOTOGRAPHY. SERPENS, 6011 787.589
THE EXPECTED FELYSIAN WORLD. IT HOSTS TWO MOONS, SPORTS A BEAUTIFUL
RING AND HAS AN INTERESTING DISTRIBUTION OF SEAS ON THE SURFACE.
I AM ALREADY EAGER TO LAND.
0.60:THE DEFAULT SPOT, WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE AN ISLAND'S EDGE.
IT DIDN'T DISSAPOINT ME, THE PLACE WAS TEEMING WITH LIFE, WHILE
AT THE SAME TIME BEING QUITE CALM. ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NOTHING
PARTICULARLY SPECTACULAR, THE PLANET SEEMS TO BE SIMPLY VERY
PRETTY. AMONG THE DENSELY GROWING, GREEN TREES, I COULD SEE THE
DISTANT OCEAN LINE THROUGH THE LEAVES.
187.60: WELL, QUITE A SUNRISE THIS WAS! I'D NEVER EXPECT TO FIND
FROZEN TERRAIN HERE, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE TEMPERATURES WERE SLIGHTLY
ABOVE 0, ACTUALLY. I APPROACHED WHAT WAS FORMERLY A SHORELINE, AND
IT WAS WEIRDLY JAGGED, AS IF SOMEONE TORE LARGE, REGULAR PIECES OF
ICE. THEN, I STOPPED AT A NEARBY CHASM, WHICH HOSTED A FROZEN POOL
ON ITS BOTTOM, AND RETREATED TO MAKE AN EXCURSION BEYOND A LARGE
HILL, ON THE SLOPE OF WHICH I LANDED. DESPITE BEING RADICALLY
DIFFERENT FROM MY EXPECTATIONS, THE PLACE WAS ASTOUNDING, A
WONDERFUL LANDSCAPE SPARKLING IN THE RISING SUN'S STRONG RAYS.
4.25: SO A CHILLY STATE IS NOT AS COMMON HERE AS I SUSPECTED. AGAIN
A VERY LUSH PLACE (ONLY WITH NO WATER), PURPLE SKY, AND TREES
WHICH ACTUALLY MATCHED THE SKY'S COLOUR! BEAUTIFUL. HOWEVER, THE
TREES WERE SO DENSE, AND TERRAIN SO ROUGH, THAT ORIENTATION WAS
ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE. I HAD TO QUICKLY RETREAT TO MY CAPSULE AFTER
FOOLING AROUND AIMLESSLY.
319.27: A BIT SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS SECTOR, ONLY DURING A VERY
NICE SUNSET. PLANTS SEEMED TO HAVE AN EVEN DEEPER PURPLE COLOUR,
PROBABLY DUE TO CONTRAST WITH THE SKY. IN THE VERY MIDDLE OF
SECTOR IS A STEEP SLOPE AND MY LANDING CUPOLA BOUNCED LIKE CRAZY
BEFORE FINALLY SETTLING PEACEFULLY.
1.4: IN MY USUAL WAY OF SAYING 'GOODBYE' TO FELYSIAN WORLDS, I
LANDED ON A FLAT, ICY, DESOLATE PLAIN. IT WASN'T LIFELESS, THOUGH -
I MANAGED TO SPOT TWO BIRDS AND A POLAR HOPPER, WHICH UNFORTUNATELY
REFUSED TO STOP HOPPING SO I COULD MAKE A GOOD PHOTO. THE PURPLISH
SKY GAVE THE PLACE A WARM LOOK, DESPITE THE FROST ALL AROUND.
SERPENS, 6011 787.591
A FELYSIAN PLANET WITH NO MOONS, SO THIS IS THE LAST OBJECT OF
THIS SYSTEM. FROM ORBIT, IT'S STRANGELY BRIGHT AND MOSTLY GREY.
THIS MAKES FOR A BLEAK LOOK. HOPEFULLY IT DOESN'T MEAN A GLOBAL
DESERT, BUT WE'LL SEE IN A WHILE...
348.59: NO DESERT HERE, INSTEAD THIS WAS AN ISLAND. THE WATER WAS
FAR AWAY, SO NATURALLY I WERE TOO LAZY TO TRY REACHING IT. INSTEAD,
I PHOTOGRAPHED A HOPPER, THE PLEASANT, GREEN SKY, CAUGHT A BIRD AND
BACKPEDALED TO THE LANDER.
358.65:AN ISLAND AGAIN, BUT A WEIRD ONE. WHEN STILL IN THE CUPOLA,
I SAW SOMETHING SUSPICIOUSLY SIMILAR TO THE OLD RUINS WHICH CAN
STILL BE FOUND ON OUR HOMEWORLDS, SO THIS TIME I WENT THERE AT
FULL SPEED, IGNORING THE HEAVY RAIN AND LIGHTNING FLASHES. SURE
ENOUGH, IT TURNED OUT TO BE A NATURAL, SPIKY HILL. OVERALL, THE
TERRAIN WAS EXTREMELY ROUGH, FULL OF ANNOYING TRAPS FOR THE
EXPLORER WHO REFUSES TO PAY ATTENTION WHILE RUNNING AROUND.
0.29:I'M GOING BACK THERE. A TRULY BEAUTIFUL PLACE, WITH A BRIGHT,
CALM SKY AND GOLDEN GRASS AND TREES WHICH DIRECTLY REMIND OF
AUTUMN. THE FIRST SIGHT CAN BE TRULY STUNNING. I STILL HAVE SOME
UNFINISHED PHOTOGRAPHIC BUSINESS IN THIS SECTOR.
154.25: THE SUNRISE SKY WAS BARELY GREENISH, ALMOST GREY, BUT THE
LANDSPACE FEAURES, ESPECIALLY A CERTAIN LAKE WHICH CAN BE SEEN
WHILE DESCENDING, MORE THAN MADE UP FOR IT. THIS IS A SPLENDID
SECTOR, WITH ENOUGH FANTASTIC SIGHTS AND BEAUTIFUL SPOTS TO KEEP
A PHOTOGRAPHER BUSY FOR A LONG TIME.
321.9: MY LAST VISIT WAS SPECTACULAR AS I LANDED BETWEEN
TRANSLUCENT ICY HILLS, WHICH SPARKLED HEAVILY IN THE STRONG
SUNLIGHT. THE BRIGHTNESS WAS SO INTENSE, I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND
GOING THERE WITHOUT SOME EYE PROTECTION. BUT NOT ONE WHICH WOULD
DIMNISH YOUR VISION TOO MUCH, BECAUSE THIS PLACE IS MAGNIFICENT,
A DRAMATIC SIGHT TO BEHOLD. I'M SADDENED TO LEAVE THIS GRAND WORLD
BEHIND, BUT EXPLORATION CALLS. PERHAPS I'LL BE BACK HERE IN THE
DISTANT FUTURE. SERPENS, 6011 788.594
SMALL, SOLID, THIN ATMOSPHERE, APPEARS TO BE ABOUT THE SIZE OF

COLOURING AS SEEN FROM ORBIT. AGAIN, THE CHANCE FOR PHOTOGRAPHY
IS PHENOMENAL. SERPENS, 6011 787.589
SMALL, SOLID, DUSTY, CRATERIZED, AND FAR ENOUGH FROM THE TWO
LARGER OBJECTS TO PREVENT ANY SPECTACULAR PHOTOS. THE MOON ITSELF
IS BRIGHT GREEN AND HAS QUITE A FEW BIG CRATERS.

CLOSEST PLANET TO ITS CLASS 0 STAR, THE VIEW OF IT FROM SPACE IS
MAGNIFICENT. LOOKED AS THOUGH IT MIGHT SUPPORT LIFE, HOPES SOON DASHED
WHEN I LANDED ON ITS SURFACE. ATMOSPHERE SIMULTANEOUSLY WARMS THE PLANET
TO BEYOND 130C (ON THE LIGHT SIDE) AND BLOCKS MOST OF THE SUN. A HOT AND
DARK PLACE, IT REMINDS ME OF EARTH ON THE MATRIX AFTER THE MACHINES TOOK
OVER. COVERED IN EITHER POOLS OF LAVA OR VERY BRIGHT ROCKS. IF YOU LIKE
YOUR PLANETS TO LOOK POSITIVELY GIGER-ESQUE, YOU'LL LOVE IT.

SOME HUGE STORMS SPOTTED FROM ORBIT. VERY CLOSE TO ITS STAR.
LANDING MAY PROVIDE SOME SPECTACULAR SIGHTS. SERPENS, 6011 665.668
MEDIUM-SIZED, THICK ATMOSPHERE, COVERED BY CLOUDS. HAS A VERY NICE
RING. COLOUR OF CLOUDS VARIES FROM RED TO BROWN, SOME STORM
ACTIVITY NOTED. LANDING MIGHT BE NOT SUCH A BAD IDEA. THE SURFACE
PRESSURE IS ANOMALOUSLY LOW FOR THIS TYPE OF PLANETS - 'ONLY' 26
FELISIAN ATMOSPHERES. SERPENS, 6011 665.668
A FELISIAN PLANET! I'M STARTING TO LIKE THIS SYSTEM... THE PLANET
IS BEAUTIFUL FROM ORBIT, HAS ONE MOON AND PRETTY DEBRIS RING.
AT 82.96, IT WAS BARREN, HILLY AND LIFELESS.
AT 28.47 I'VE LANDED IN THE MIDDLE OF WATER. SPOTTED AQUATIC LIFE.
ON 36.60, I'VE SEEN A HOPPER, BUT NO PLANT LIFE, AGAIN. INSTEAD,
THERE WAS A GAPING CHASM TO THE NORTHWEST. IT SEEMS THAT THIS
PLANET IS TOO CLOSE TO ITS SUN TO SUPPORT COMPLEX ECOSYSTEM, BUT
WE'LL SEE... AT 44.5, THE GROUND WAS BARREN, BUT I'VE
SEEN TWO BIRDS AND A HOPPER. TEMPERATURE WAS ONLY JUST BELOW ZERO -
AT SUBPOLAR REGION! I WONDER WHAT THE POLES ARE LIKE...
AT 24.1, THE TEMPERATURE WAS -7 CELSIUS (YES! AT THE POLE!). NO
LIFE. 78.65 - LARGE BODY OF WATER. 0.60 - A RATHER
DESPERATE ATTEMPT TO FIND LIFE-RICH AREA, BUT I FINALLY SUCCEDEED!
THERE'S A DENSE FOREST AT THE VERY EQUATOR.
I HAVE ONE HYPOTHESIS ABOUT THIS PLANET. ITS RING IS SEEMINGLY FROM
THE SAME MATERIAL, AND IS PROBABLY A RESULT OF LARGE COLLISION.
THE SAME COLLISION MIGHT HAVE WIPED MOST OF THE LIFE, LEAVING MORE
COMPLEX ECOSYSTEMS ONLY IN FEW AREAS. SERPENS, 6011 665.670
MEDIUM-SIZED, FELISIAN (YES!) WORLD, BREATHABLE ATMOSPHERE. THERE
SEEMS TO BE VERY LITTLE WATER ON THE SURFACE. 4.53 - ACTUALLY, THE
ABOVE NOTE ABOUT LACK OF WATER IS UNTRUE. I'VE LANDED ON A SHORE.
THE WATER HAS WONDERFUL COLOUR, THERE ARE ALSO MANY, VERY GREEN
TREES. THIS, IN ADDITION TO A STAR LOOMING ON THE SKY, MAKES FOR A
REALLY SPECTACULAR SIGHT. YOU SIMPLY HAVE TO SEE IT.
347.57 - WAY WORSE. GROUND IS BARREN, AND, ALTHOUGHT THE TEMPRETA-
TURE IS POSITIVE, WATER SEEMS TO BE FROZEN, WHICH WOULD EXPLAIN THE
WATERLESS APPEARANCE FROM ORBIT. I'VE SPOTTED AVIAN LIFE, THOUGH.
28.61 - ALMOST EQUATORIAL AREA, BUT AGAIN - BARREN.
358.30 - I DIDN'T EXPECT MUCH, BUT THE AREA IS SUPRISINGLY GREEN
AND GRASSY, THERE ARE ALSO BRUSHES SCATTERED HERE AND THERE (AND,
CONTRARY TO WHAT I COULD SEE ON MY FIRST LANDING) THEY'RE DEEP RED.
I'VE ALSO SEEN LOTS OF HOPPERS.
0.1 - NOTHING HERE. SERPENS, 6011 665.671
YET ANOTHER INTERESTING PLANET. THIS ONE IS SMALL, SOLID,
CRATERIZED, HAS A DEBRIS RING, BUT WHAT'S REMARKABLE IS
REFLECTIVITY - PLACES WITH LOWER ALTITUDE HAVE REALLY ENORMOUS
REFLECTIVITY. IN ADDITION, THE SURFACE APPEARS PURPLE FROM THE
ORBIT. AGAIN, YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS. SERPENS, 6011 665.672
I'M REALLY OUT OF WORDS... SMALL, DUSTY, CRATERIZED, NO ATMOSPHERE
- THIS DESCRITPION IS CLEARLY NOT INVITING, BUT DON'T GET FOOLED!
IT'S AGAIN A NICE-LOOKING BODY WITH INTRIGUING, LIGHT BROWN
SURFACE, STUNNING SPOTS OF HUGE REFLECTIVITY AND SOME REMARKABLE
CRATERS. SERPENS, 6011 665.672
SMALL AND SOLID, THIN ATMOSPHERE. I MUST SAY THAT I WAS QUITE
DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PLANET, AS I'VE BEEN EXPECTING SOMETHING
UNUSUAL, WHILE THIS PLANET IS NOT WORTH THE LITHIUM USED IN THE
FLIGHT. SERPENS, 6011 665.673
SOLID, OXYGEN ATMOSPHERE, SURFACE IS MAINLY NATIVE QUARTZ, BUT I'VE
BEEN UNABLE TO FIND MUCH QUARTZ HERE. MAYBE I'VE LANDED IN WRONG
PLACE. THE GRAVITY AND ATMOSPHERE ARE VERY SIMILAR TO THOSE OF

SERPENS, 6011 665.673

287.61 IT WAS FAIRLY FLAT, GRASSY WITH BUSHES. AT 218.71 THERE'S WATER
WITH A HUGE MESA-LIKE MOUNTAIN STICKING OUT. GOOD FOR CLIMBERS, BAD
FOR ME. AT 221.72 THERE APPEARS TO BE A NUMBER OF SMALL PONDS ALONG
WITH SHRUBS AND SMALL PLANTS, I NOTED A NUMBER OF BIRDS FLYING AROUND,
BUT NO HOPPERS. SKINNYMON EPOC 6011 579.14

A GAS GIANT WITH A RATHER NICE DEBRIS RING.
(NOTE BY SHADOWCLAW 6011:571.265)
THIS PLANET IS A GAS GIANT, A WELCOME CHANGE FROM THE REST OF THE
SYSTEM. (NOTES BY SHADOWCLAW 6011:571.264)
THIS MOON SEEMS TO BE COVERED WITH *HUGE* OVERLAPPING CRATERS,
PRESUMABLY DUE TO COLLISIONS WITH VARIOUS PROTOPLANETS, THIS
BEING A RELATIVELY NEW SYSTEM. ODDLY, THE MOON ALSO HARBOURS
EXTENSIVE RUINS. COULD THERE HAVE BEEN A COLONY HERE AT ONE TIME?
PERSONALLY, I DOUBT IT, WHAT WITH ALL THE OTHER BODIES IN THE
SYSTEM - ONE COULD ALL TO EASILY BE NUDGED OUT OF ORBIT AND CRASH
INTO THE MOON CAUSING DESTRUCTION OF ANY OUTPOST THERE. THE RUINS
SEEM TO SUPPORT THIS HYPOTHESIS.
(NOTES BY SHADOWCLAW, 6011:571.266)
I WAS SURPRISED TO FIND THIS MOON. SINCE I CAN'T LAND, I CAN ONLY
SPECULATE AS TO WHAT'S DOWN THERE.
(NOTES BY SHADOWCLAW 6011:571.272)

ANOTHER PLANET WITH LOW CLOUD COVER.SOME VERY STEEP VALLEYS THE ONLY
INTERESTING FEATURE NOT SOMEWHERE I WOULD WANT TO LIVE,VERY DEPRESSING.
NOTES BY (NARK SHUTTLEWORTH EPOC 6011:569:6)
AT FIRST SITE THIS PLANET LOOKS LIKE A GIANT DESERT.
BUT AT COORS 200.60 THERE IS AN INCREDIBLE CANYON
THIS IS WELL WORTH A LOOK.

YET ANOTHER DRAB PLANET THIS SYSTEM'S FAVOURITE COLOUR IS BROWN!!!
PLENTY OF LIFE ABOUT THOUGH MUST BE COLOUR BLIND.
NOTES BY (MARK SHUTTLEWORTH EPC 6011:569:766)
IT WAS POURING WITH RAIN WHEN I LANDED ON THIS PLANET.
ONE OF THE LIFE FORMS TOOK AN INTEREST IN MY LANDING CAPSULE.
I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE TREES ALTHOUGH IT WAS STILL DRAB.
NOTES BY (MARK SHUTTLEWORTH EPOC 6011:569:29)
VISIBILITY IS VERY POOR ON THIS PLANET.
IT WOULD BE EASY TO GET LOST NOT MUCH TO SEE.
NOTES BY (MARK SHUTTLEWORTH EPOC 6011:569:31)
THIS MOON IS GREAT IF YOU LIKE HIDDEN VALLEYS.
SOME OF THE SITES ARE SPECTACULAR ALTHOUGH THERE IS STILL NO COLOUR.
NOTES BY (MARK SHUTTLEWORTH EPOC 6011:569:30)
THIS MOON IS HIGHLY UNSTABLE AND NOT SAFE TO LAND ON.

NOTES BY (MARK SHUTTLEWORTH EPOC 6011:569:201)
ANOTHER DULL CLOUD COVERED MOON THIS SYSTEM DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE ANY
SPECTACULAR PLANETS OR MOONS.
NOTES BY (MARK SHUTTLEWORTH EPOC 6011:569:201)
THE MOST COLOURFUL PLACE IN THE SYSTEM YET.
THE SKY IS A BEAUTIFUL SHADE OF RED.
AND THE SURFACE IS COVERED WITH RED CRYSTALS.
STILL A BIT DARK FOR DECENT PHOTOGRAPHS.
NOTES BY (MARK SHUTTLEWORTH EPOC 6011:569:202)
THE LANDSCAPE ON THIS MOON CONSISTS OF ROLLING GREEN HILLS.
AND EVERY SO OFTEN YOU COME ACROSS AN ENORMOUS HILL.
NOT MUCH ELSE OF INTEREST.

345:60 SAW AN INTERESTING ISLAND MOUNTAIN TO THE NORTH. THE CLIMB TO
THE TOP WAS NOT AS HARD AS I HAD EXPECTED, THE SWIM TO THE MOUNTAIN
TOOK MORE TIME THAN THE CLIMB TO THE TOP. THE VIEW WAS AMAZING, AND THE
LEAP INTO THE WATER WAS SPECTACULAR WITH THE LESSENED GRAVITY.

SURICRASIA: ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PLANETS IN THE WHOLE GALAXY, AT
LEAST FROM MY POINT OF VIEW. NOBODY SHOULD MISS THE SURICRASIAN SKY AT
THE SUNRISE: ITS SCARLET SHADES ARE - WHAT COULD I SAY? - INSPIRING!
ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING QUADRANTS IS AT COORDINATES 18:60, WHERE THE
SO-CALLED 'SURICRASIAN CUBE', AN IMMENSE AND ANCIENT STRUCTURE NOW
COVERED WITH GRASS, IS SURROUNDED BY SMALL LAKES WHOSE WATERS PLAY WITH
THE REFLECTIONS OF ANCIENT BUILDINGS. AND TALKING OF LAKES, THERE IS AN
ARTIFICIAL LAKE AT COORDINATES 219:78, WHERE A SQUARE OF PILLARS ERUPTS
FROM THE GROUND BELOW THE WATER. MOST OF THE PLANET'S SURFACE IS NOW
DESERT, AND VEGETABLES ARE RARE, PROBABLY BECAUSE THERE ARE NO OCEANS OR
LARGE SEAS. NONETHELESS, THE ATMOSPHERE IS RICH IN VAPOUR, WHICH FORMS A
LARGE NUMBER OF CLOUDS ESPECIALLY NEAR THE PLANET'S EQUATOR.
NOTES WRITTEN BY ALEX GHIGNOLA, EPOC 6011:557.470
ON 46.102 I FOUND SOME RATHER ODD LANDFORMS.
THEY ARE BIG ODD PURPLE MOUNDS.
ONE OF THEM HAS A GREEN MOUND IN THE CENTER OF THE PURPLE.
(NOTE BY EXPLORER EPOC 6011:568.334)
FURTHER NOTES:AS I RECALL, MY MOTHER SPOKE ILL OF SURICRASIA, BUT
THAT WAS PROBABLY BECAUSE OF MY FATHER, A SON OF A HOPPER WHO WAS
NEVER THERE WHEN HE WAS NEEDED. BUT ENOUGH OF THAT.
ACTUALLY, EXPLORER WAS ACCURATE: SIMILAR FINDS AT 337.42, 347.43
AND 38.62. HOWEVER, I NOTICED AT THE LAST LOCATION, THE 'PINK'
HAD WALLS. THIS MAY BE EXCAVATION, WHO KNOWS? HOWEVER, AT 359.44
BEWARE, YOU'LL LAND ON AN EDGE. ALSO THERE IS A BIG PINK MONOLITH
STRUCTURE. AT ANY RATE, I DECIDED TO DO A SUNRISE. SO I
WENT TO 186.58. THERE'S AN ISLAND THERE, AND PROBABLY THE ONLY
PLANT LIFE YOU'LL SEE ON THE PLANET. A FOREST. AND I SAW THE
SUNRISE ON THE OCEANSIDE. QUITE NICE. SKINNYMON EPOC 6011 570.831
I FOUND A WEIRD, PURPLE, SQUARE CANYON AND A PURPLE OBELISK AT:
THESE COORDINATES: 263:24 AND 313:35. OVERTILT EPOC '11 571.549.300
A WIERD MOUND AT 285.63. IT IS ONE OF THE HOLES THAT ARE FOUND BOTH
BOTH PLEASANCE AND FELYSIA. AMWHERE 6011.572.217
IMPOSSIBLY INCREDIBLY UNBELIEVABLY REALLY HUGE BUILDING AT 153.37
HOW TALL IS IT? WHEN YOU LAND/TAKEOFF, THE LANDER 'APPEARS'/'DIS-
APPEARS' JUST *ABOVE* ITS TOP!!!! YOU *CAN'T* SEE OVER IT!!!
COVERS A LOT OF GROUND, TOO - FARTHEST CORNER AT 153.37:-36.-72
FOUND BY RICHARD SOLENSKY EPOC 6011-578.524.300
AT 281.73, YOU'LL LAND ON TOP OF A HUGE CUBE WITH 2 ROWS OF 10
PYRAMIDS EACH ON TOP. I ESTIMATE, FROM THE TIME IT TAKES TO REACH
THE BOTTOM WHEN YOU JUMP OFF, THAT IT'S ABOUT A *MILE* HIGH!
FOUND BY RICHARD SOLENSKY EPOC 6011-581.893.048
AT 46.53 THERE ARE TWO ALMOST STARDRIFTER-SHAPED PURPLE OBJECTS,
AND A SPIRE CLOSE BY. THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ANY CATNIP THERE
THOUGH. ;-) (SHADOWCLAW 6011:583.802)
225.60 IS INTERESTING. I'M NOT SAYING ANY MORE. (SHADOWCLAW)
CONFIRMATION OF EXPLORER SOLENSKY'S CUBE.FURTHER EXPLORATION AT
BASE OF CUBE REVEALED A SPRAWLING GREY FORTRESS-LIKE STRUCTURE.
LOCATION OF STRUCTURE IS 281.73:5.-44. THE CLIMB BACK TO THE TOP
OF THE CUBE TOOK SEVERAL100 TRIADS DEXTER. (NOTES BY SCAREDY-CAT,
EPOC 6011.584.95)
I THINK I HAVE FOUND THE CUBE'S BIG BROTHER! YES, YOU HEARD THAT
CORRECTLY, THERE'S ANOTHER CUBE AT COORDINATES 43:33 AND IT'S
MONSTROUSLY GIGANTIC! THE TEMPERATURE DIFFERENCE FROM TOP TO BOTTOM
WAS ABOUT 8 DEGREES CELSIUS. THE TOP OF THE CUBE IS TOO LARGE FOR
SECTOR BOUNDARIES. THE PURPLE SUNSET MADE THE WHOLE SCENE EVEN
MORE SURREAL. (WRITTEN BY SCHMERM 6011 579.904)
I AM SPEECHLESS... THE CUBE THAT I MENTIONED IN THE ABOVE ENTRY
IS GONE!!! IN ITS LOCATION IS NOW A CUBIC HOLE IN THE GROUND WITH
A LARGE MOUND INSIDE. YOU WILL FIND THIS SOUTH OF THE LANDING SITE
AT 43:33, PAST THE LARGE STRUCTURE IN THE WAY, AT SUBCOORDS 59.15,
IGNORING + OR - SIGNS OF COURSE. IN OTHER NEWS, THE CUBE HAS
MYSTERIOUSLY MOVED TO 11:41 AS OF THIS TIME. (SCHMERM 6011 584.37)
FURTHER NOTES:A REPORT DECRIBING A 'VANISHING' STRUCTURE AT 153.37
MANAGED TO REACH ME, AND SINCE I WAS IN THE VICINITY, I
INVESTIGATED. NO LARGE STRUCTURE WAS THERE, BUT THERE WAS WHAT
APPEARED TO BE A MINING HILLSIDE AND A LARGE EVIL PIT SOME DISTANCE
AWAY, AND A FEW PYRAMIDS. I DECIDED TO CONDUCT A SEARCH OF THE
AREAS IMMDIATELY SURROUNDING 153.37, OUT OF CURIOSITY. AT 152.36
I LANDED TWICE WHERE THERE WAS TWO CUBES, ONE AT A DISTANCE WITH
8 SPOTS ON TOP, THE OTHER I LANDED ON. IT HAS A CALDERA THAT LEADS
TO A DANGEROUS LARGE GAPING SHAFT. I LANDED THERE AGAIN LATER AND
THE DISTANT CUBE WAS GONE. AT 152.36 IT WAS HILLY WITH NOTHING OF
INTEREST. AT 154.36, A WATERY GRAVE AWAITS YOU WITH A COLLECTION
OF PYRAMIDS IN THE WATER. AT 154.37 HILLY AND NOTHING OF INTEREST.
AT 154.38, A LARGE RECTANGULAR STRUCTURE AND ANOTHER CUBE. AT
153.38, THERE'S A REALLY, REALLY, REALLY STRANGE LOOKING STRUCTURE.
LOOKS LIKE THIN WALLS WITH ENORMOUS CRACKS GOING DOWN. I DON'T
KNOW WHY THIS THING HASN'T COLLAPSED OVER THE EPOCS. THERE'S A
SMALLER STRUCTURE NEARBY. IT'S WORTH A VISIT. AT 152.38 IT LOOKS
LIKE YOUR BASIC MARSHLAND TO ME. AT 152.37 THERE I SAW AN ENORMOUS
WALL WITH ANOTHER LARGE RECTANGULAR STRUCTURE NEARBY. I REVISITED
152.37 AND FOUND THE WALL AND THE TALL STRUCTURE HAD BEEN REPLACED
BY MOUNDS OF PURPLE MATERIAL- WITH HOPPERS JUMPING UP AND DOWN.
AGAIN, AT 153.37 WHAT APPEARS TO BE A CUBE WITH A PURPLE FACE HAD
APPEARED. I EXPANDED MY SEARCH TO FORM A 'FELISIAN GRID' (5X5). AT
151.36, IN THE WATER, A 'STARFISH' SPIRE AND A FLAT STRUCTURE WITH
WHAT APPEARS TO BE A GRASSY MOUND ON TOP. AT 151.37 IT WAS FLAT
WITH SOME BUSHY PLANT LIFE, BUT NO STRUCTURES. AT 151.38, AN
ENORMOUS PURPLE CUBE. AT 155.36, A TALL RECTANGULAR STRUCTURE AND
A NEARBY SCRAPED OUT CLIFF. AT 155.37, A TALL RECTANGULAR STRUCTURE
AT 155.38 AND 151.39 IT'S HILLY WITH NOTHING REMARKABLE. AT 152.39
THERE'S A TALL PURPLE CUBE WITH A MOUNDLIKE PROJECTION ON TOP. AT
153.39, IT WAS HILLY, NOTHING REMARKABLE. AT 154.39 A VERY LARGE
PURPLE CUBE. AT 155.39 A TALL PURPLE SPIRE WITH MANY GOUGES IN THE
SOIL. AT 155.35, A PURPLE 'STARFISH' SPIRE AND A VERY LARGE PITLIKE
AREA.AT 154.35, UPON LANDING, I REALIZED THERE WERE CORNERS TO THE
LANDING AREA. I WAS ATOP A LARGE CUBE WITH A SMALLER STRUCTURE WITH
A PURPLE FACADE NEARBY; HOWEVER, INTERESTINGLY AS I LANDED ON TOP
OF THE CUBE, I WAS GREETED BY...A HOPPER. AT 153.35, A RECTANGULAR
STRUCTURE AND A GOUGE WITH A LARGE PURPLE MOUND. AT 152.35 THERE
WAS A SMALL HILLY FOREST. AT 151.35 IN THE WATER AGAIN WITH MORE
FLAT OBJECTS WITH MOUNDS ON TOP AND WHAT APPEARED TO BE THE TOP OF
A SPIRE. CONTINUING THE 'FELISIAN GRID' CONCEPT CENTERED ON THE
SURICRASIAN CUBE, AT 18.60, OF COURSE THERE WAS THE CUBE AND DON'T
FORGET THE NEARBY 'PIT OF DOOM' TOWARD THE EAST. (FUN FOR THE WHOLE
FAMILY!). AT 19.60, THERE IS A LARGE PIT AREA WHICH HAS A LIGHT
COLORED FRINGE ALMOST LIKE A PATHWAY ALL AROUND IT. THERE'S WHAT
APPEARS TO BE A STELE IN THE DISTANCE. AT 17.61 THERE'S A CUBE WITH
AN ORGANIC-LOOKING DOME ON TOP. ANOTHER 'PATHWAY' GOES IN FRONT OF
THE CUBE AND HEADS IN THE DIRECTION OF A STELE IN THE DISTANCE TO
THE WEST. AT 18.61 THERE'S ONLY A PURPLE 'FLOWING' AREA IN THE
DISTANCE. AT 19.61 AND 19.60 THERE'S NOTHING BUT HILLY GROUND. AT
19.59 THERE'S A PIT WITH AN EDGE TO THE EAST, TWO CUBES TO THE WEST
AT 18.59, A FORESTED AREA. AT 17.59, LANDED ON TOP OF ANOTHER CUBE
WITH A SHAFT, HOWEVER, THE CALDERA AROUND THE SHAFT LOOKS CRACKED.
SAW ANOTHER HOPPER ATOP THIS CUBE AND I TRIED TO FOLLOW HIM, AND HE
DISAPPEARED, BUT I SAW WHY- HE WAS TRYING TO LEAD ME INTO A
PIT-LIKE AREA. (THE LITTLE TWERP!) AT 16.59 DESCEND ON LANDING
INTO A PIT-LIKE AREAWITH 'WAVY' WALLS AND PYRAMIDS INSIDE. THERE'S
A GAP AREA AT ONE END AND THE WHOLE THING IS OVERLOOKED BY A CUBE
ABOVE THE PIT. LOOKS LIKE AN ESTATE OWNED BY A SURICRASIAN
OPERATING SYSTEM SOFTWARE BARON. :) AT 16.60 THERE'S NOTHING ASIDE
FROM A TALL PEAK TO THE SOUTH. AT 16.61 THERE'S NOTHING BUT HILLY
GROUND. AT 16.62 THERE'S A LARGE UNNATURAL GAP OFF TO THE NORTH-
PROBABLY NOTHING. AT 17.62, NOTHING BUT HILLY GROUND. AT 18.62,
TWO LARGE PITS. AT 19.62 THERE'S A VERY TALL CYLINDRICAL STRUCTURE
(NO CORNERS) SITTING IN A PIT. AT 20.62, NOTHING BUT HILLY GROUND.
AT 20.61 A LARGE PIT NEAR FORESTED GROUND AND AN UNNATURAL NOTCH
TO THE WEST. AT 20.60, A FLAT BUILDING WITH A MOUND (AS I'VE SEEN
IN THE WATER HERE), PYRAMIDS, A SMALL STRUCTURE; THE AREA IS
COVERED WITH MANY PONDS (WATERS RECEEDING?) AT 20.59 A CUBE AND A
SPIRE. AT 20.58, NOTHING BUT HILLY GROUND. AT 19.58, A LARGE PIT.
AT 18.58 A FEW ISLANDS WITH BUSHES. NICE BEACH FRONT FOR SWIMMING
AND SUNNING (SWIMMING I HATE. SUNNING IS OK, BUT AFTER A WHILE MY
FUR GETS TOO WARM.) AT 17.58, TALL PEAKS WITH WHAT APPEARS TO BE AN
UNNATURAL GAP ON THE HORIZON, PYRAMIDS. AT 16.58 A COUPLE OF LARGE
PITS. (ONE WITH ONE OF THOSE UNNATURAL GAPS.) THERE'S NO GUARANTEE
AS TO WHETHER ANY OF THINGS WILL EXIST IF YOU VISIT THESE AREAS,
ASIDE FROM THE HILLY GROUND ONES, BUT I THOUGHT THE EPLORATION WAS
WORTH THE EFFORT. SKINNYMON EPOC 6011 579.540
COMPLEX OF 4 LOW CUBES, EACH TOPPED WITH A DOME AT 346.68. ALL ARE
GRAY,BUT 1 HAS A GREEN DOME. OH, THEY ARE ALL SURROUNDED BY H20.
AND THERE ARE 2 SMALL ISLANDS TO REST ON NEARBYOBJECTS ARE COVERED
BY WILD LIFE. I WONDER WHAT THEY WERE USED FOR.
PERHAPS A SEA PORT. DEFINITLY WORTH A LOOK.(SCAREDY-CAT6011.587.896
HUGEGRASS COVERED MILE HIGH CUBE AT 56.60. ON TOP I SAW A HOPPER
JUMP OFF THE EDGE. THEN, RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME AANOTHER APPEARED
OUT OF THIN AIR AND THEN JUMPED OFF. ONE AFTER ANOTHER DID THIS
AND I HAVE NAMED THIS
LEMMING CUBE (SCAREDY-CAT, EPOC 6011.588.373)
55.60 IS INTERESTING. LARGE GREY CUBE TOPPED WITH GREEN DOME AT
TOP OF DOME IS A SQUARE ELEVATOR SHAFT WHICH DESCENDS TO THE BOTTOM
OF THE CUBE. CUBE IS SURROUNDED BY A DRY MOAT. CANYONS, HILLS AND
A LARGE GREY PIT WITH A LOW GREY DOME IS IN THEAREA (SCAREDY-CAT,
6011.588.376)
VISITED THE STARDRIFTER COMPLEX NOTED ABOVE. SAW ANOTHER
TRICHORDITE COMPLEX AND ALSO NOTED THAT THE SHIP-SHAPED COMPLEXES
ARE ON A RIVER BANK. COULD THESE BE CRASH SITES OR SEAPORTS?

OOPS. SORRY ABOUT THAT.
55.60;FOUND THE LARGE PURPLE CUBE, MANAGED TO JUMP TO THE TOP...
STILL FIGURING HOW I DID IT, ANYWAY CLIMBED THE DOME AND FELL
DOWN THE ELEVATOR SHAFT. WICKED *LONGDROP*!

AFTER A LONG ABSENCE, I HAVE RETURNED TO SURICRASIA. I INTEND TO
EXPLORE SOME OF THE NORTHERN AREAS THAT I DID NOT BEFORE. I WILL
THEN GO BACK INTO DEEP SPACE.(SCAREDY-CAT, 6011.602.546)
A PAIR OF DOME-TOPPED LOW CUBES AT 355.13. THEY ARE SET INTO A
FROZE SEA. THEY REMIND ME OF A PAIR OF STARDRIFTERS BECAUSE OF THE
REFLECTION. (NOTE BY SCAREDY-CAT, EPOC 6011.602.979)
MOST UNUSUAL TERRAIN AT 253.56. TWO VERY LARGEPITS AND TWO VERY
LARGE CUBES. I SCALED ONE CUBE. IT WAS VERY HARD TO CLIMB. I HAD
EXPECTED TO ROAM AROUND AT THE TOP, BUT AS SOON AS I REACHED IT, I
BEGAN TO FALL ALL THE WAY TO THE BASE. APPARENTLY, THIS CUBE WAS
HOLLOW, LIKE A BOX WITH NO LID. AT THE BOTTOM WAS A DOME AND A VERY
DOCILE HOPPER WHO DIDN'T GO ANYWHERE THE WHOLE TIME I WAS THERE.
THIS IS WORTH A LOOK TO EXPLORER WHO WANT TO SEE SOMETHING UNUSUAL
(SCAREDY-CAT, EPOC 6011.603.154)
AT 280:85 I'VE FOUND A GIANT CUBE AND A FEW INTERESTING MOUNTAINS.
AT 287.79 I'VE SEEN A TRULY GIGANTIC CUBE. AMAZING...
308.31 - ANOTHER CUBIC FORMATION AND PURPLE MOUNTAINS ON THE
HORZON.
127.35 - TWO STUNNING FORMATIONS. UNBELIEVABLE... IS THERE A MORE
BEAUTIFUL PLANET IN THIS GALAXY? SERPENS, 6011 665.358

WELL, ANOTHER POLLUTED LOOKING PLANET. BETTER GO DOWN AND TAKE A L
(REPORT FROM SURFACE) AS I EXPECTED, A BARREN PLANET. *YAWN*
A HOT ROCK...YIPITY DOO DA (SARCASM)
WELL, I'M DONE HERE. LET'S SEE...WHERE TO NEXT?
THE FIRST COMPANION STAR. I'LL SEE IF IT HAS ANY PLANETS.
SERPENS, 6011 787.513
ANOTHER COMPANION STAR. THE LAST ONE HAD NO PLANETS, WE'LL SEE
ABOUT THIS ONE. BY THE WAY, ALL ARE GREY. SERPENS, 6011 787.513
WELL, NOT QUITE A COMPANION STAR, BUT ALMOST. A VERY BRIGHT
SUBSTELLAR OBJECT WITH AT LEAST A FEW MOONS. MAYBE ONE OF THEM
IS FELYSIAN? THE FIRST THREE STARS CAN BE SEEN FINELY FROM
HERE, SOME 50 DYAMS AWAY. THEY FORM A FAIRLY CLOSE TRIO.
SERPENS, 6011 787.513
ANOTHER COMPANION STAR (THIS ONE IS BLUE) AND THE FIRST LONGER
HOURNEY HERE, ALMOST 400 DYAMS FROM PLANET 3. ANY PLANETS?
AT LEAST ONE SEEN ON APPROACH, PROBABLY MORE PRESENT.
SERPENS, 6011 787.517
WELL, TIME TO MOVE ON. NO MORE PLANETS AT NO.4, AND THE FIFTH
OBJECT OF THIS SYSTEM IS, BY DESCRIPTION, SMALL AND CRATERIZED.
THE OVER 500 DYAM JOURNEY IS SLOWLY COMING TO ITS END.
AND NOW I CAN SEE IT. IT'S RINGED (BUT THE RING IS BEST SEEN
FROM A DISTANCE), HAS SOME CRATERS AND A MOON WHICH I'LL
SHORTLY INVESTIGATE. SERPENS, 6011 787.522
A COMPANION STAR 5500 DYAMS AWAY FROM PLANET 5. I'LL TRY
GOING THERE, AND HOPEFULLY I HAVE ENOUGH LITHIUM, BUT ANYWAY
A LONG JOURNEY IS IN ORDER.
I'M HERE, AND IT WASN'T EVEN AS LONG AS I EXPECTED. NO PLANETS
COULD BE SEEN WHILE APPROACHING, BUT MAYBE THERE ARE SOME
SMALL ONES HIDING. SERPENS, 6011 787.523
SO THERE WERE NO PLANETS ORBITING NO. 6 AT ALL, AND THIS ONE,
ANOTHER COMPANION STAR, IS 37 000 DYAMS AWAY. I'M NOT SURE IF
IT'S EVEN WITHIN REACH OF MY STARDRIFTER. BUT I'LL TRY.
WELL, IN FACT IT WAS OUTSIDE MY REACH, BUT I MANAGED TO GET
THERE ANYWAY USING A 'TRICK'. LET'S NOT DISCUSS THIS. THE STAR
HAS 18 OR SO PLANETS, AND ONE OF THEM, I'LL REVEAL THIS, IS
FELYSIAN, SO THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF EXPLORING AHEAD.
SERPENS, 6011 787.525
HEH, DID I MENTION SOMETHING ABOUT A FELYSIAN MOON? IT
APPEARS THAT I NAMED THIS STAR SYSTEM PROPERLY. THE USUAL
ATMOSPHERIC STORMS AREN'T TOO NUMEROUS HERE, REVEALING A
GREENISH SURFACE DOMINATED BY LAND, BUT ALSO WITH MANY SMALL
SEAS. LET'S SEE IF THE GREEN COLOUR MEANS LIFE.
79.60:LIFE? BARELY. THE SOIL WAS INDEED GREENISH, BUT I
LANDED IN A COMPLETE DESERT. BUT STILL, THERE WAS A BIRD
FLYING AROUND, AND THE PRIMARY STARS ON A BROWNISH SKY
PROVIDED SOME PLEASANT SIGHTS.
70.47: THIS SECTOR WAS SUPPOSED TO BE NEAR WATER, AND IT
INDEED WAS. AFTER SOME RUNNING, I MANAGED TO REACH A
PLEASANT SHORE. THERE WERE ALSO SOME GREENISH BUSHES. THE
SKY HAD A STRANGE, BLEAK YELLOW COLOURS. ALSO NO ANIMALS
AROUND, EXCEPT BIRDS, WHICH SEEM TO BE PLENTIFUL HERE.
269.26: I WANTED A SUNRISE, BUT I NEVER THOUGHT I WAS
GOING TO LAND IN THE DESERT. NONETHELESS, THE SIGHT WAS
GRAND AND INSPIRING. THE GROUND LOOKED ALMOST LIKE MADE OF
SAPPHIRES.
67.9: QUITE A BIT OF ICE HERE, AND ALMOST COMPLETELY
TRANSPARENT, TOO! A WONDERFUL PLACE, THIS MOON IS A REAL GEM
FOR SIGHTSEEING. THIS SECTOR IS ALSO PERFECT FOR TAKING
PHOTOGRAPHS. THE TWO PRIMARY STARS LOOM ABOVE THE HORIZON,
LOOKING LIKE TWO EYES GLARING FROM THE SKY.
81.54: A DESERT. IT'S INTERESTING HOW SAND AND ROCKS ALMOST
LOOK LIKE GRASS, BUT I'D LIKE TO FIND A REAL LUSH PLACE
BEFORE I MOVE ON.
142.65 - DESERT. LARGE CHASMS COULD BE SEEN IN THE DISTANCE,
BUT I DIDN'T INVESTIGATE.
80.47: ANOTHER DESERT SECTOR. THE DISTANT HILLS GLOWED
EERILY IN THE SUNLIGHT. THERE MUST BE SOMETHING HIGHLY
REFLECTIVE IN LOCAL SAND.
110.27: DESERT AGAIN AND I'M GIVING UP. HOPEFULLY THIS WORLD
WILL GET BLESSED BY AN EXPLORER WITH MORE PATIENCE IN THE
FUTURE. SERPENS, 6011 787.515
HMM, MEDIUM-SIZED, FELYSIAN, BREATHABLE ATMOSPHERE. FROM THE
ORBIT IT'S SPLENDID, DARK PURPLE IN COLOUR, WITH MANY STORMS
AND SEAS VISIBLE. NOW LET'S DESCEND THERE.
152.58: AH, WHAT A PARADISE! BRIGHT BLUE SKY, GRASS AND
BUSHES EVERYWHERE, A THINLY POPULATED FOREST ON A LARGE HILL
TO THE SOUTH AND WATER TO THE NORTH. IN THE WATER, I FOUND A
VERY PHOTOGENIC CHARGER. ALSO, I THINK THERE'S A ROCK TO THE
EAST, SOMEWHERE. IT MUST BE THERE.
337.59: I WISHED TO SEE THE SUNRISE SKY, WHICH TURNED OUT
TO BE EERILY GREENISH. THERE'S A CHASM JUST NEXT TO THE
LANDING SPOT, A BIG MOUNTAIN SOMEWHERE TO THE NORTH, AND
A FEW TINY LAKES ALL AROUND. ANOTHER PLEASANT PLACE.
175.28 - AN ISLAND, WITH TWO SMALLER ONES IN THE VICINITY.
JUST ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL PLACE, LOOK AT THE WONDERFUL BLUE SKY!
155.11: A BARREN, FROST-COVERED PLAIN, AS COULD BE EXPECTED.
IT'S SOMEWHAT WEIRD, THOUGH, THAT THE ICE HERE IS... BLACK.
AND WITH THIS MYSTERY LEFT UNEXPLAINED, I'M MOVING ON TO
THE NEXT MOON. SERPENS, 6011 787.517
MEDIUM-SIZED, ROCKY, CREASED, NO ATMOSPHERE. THIS MOON HAS
MANY LARGE CRATERS AND DARK, DUSTY AREAS WHICH MAKE IT WAY
MORE INTERESTING TO LOOK AT THAN MOST OBJECTS OF ITS CLASS.
SERPENS, 6011 787.517
MEDIUM-SIZED, ROCKY, CREASED. THE SURFACE LACK NOTABLE
FEATURES, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF TWO, MAYBE THREE SMALL
CRATERS. SERPENS, 6011 787.518
A MEDIUM-SIZED PLANET WITH A THICK ATMOSPHERE. THE CLOUD
COVER IS GREENISH, BUT VERY MURKY AND FAR FROM SMOOTH.
AT LEAST TWO (PINK) STORMS CAN BE SEEN. LANDING REVEALED A
RATHER DARK, BROWNISH ENVIRONMENT WITH THE NEARBY STAR
SHINING INTENSELY THROUGH THE CLOUDS. SERPENS, 6011 787.518
MEDIUM-SIZED, INTERNALLY HOT, UNSTABLE. OTHING REALLY
UNUSUAL HERE, EXCEPT THAT IT APPEARS TO GO VERY FAST ON ITS
ORBIT. PERHAPS THIS EXPLAINS WHY IT'S INTERNALLY HOT.
SERPENS, 6011 787.518
MEDIUM-SIZED, WITH AN OXYGEN ATMOSPHERE, MOSTLY HARM... I
MEAN, MOSTLY QUARTZ. THE SURFACE I'D DESCRIBE AS VERY BRIGHT
PINK, THOUGH IT TURNS OUT TO BE CONSIDERABLY DARKER UPON
LANDING. IF YOU DON'T LOOK AT THE SKY, THAT IS.
SERPENS, 6011 787.519
WELL, A FELYSIAN PLANET OUT HERE! FROM ORBIT, AN INTERESTING
PATTERN FORMED BY SEAS (NUMEROUS, BUT SMALL) AND CLOUDS CAN
BE SEEN, WHILE THERE'S ALSO A HUGE AREA COMPLETELY DEVOID
OF THEM. LET'S TAKE A CLOSER LOOK.
18.60: I LANDED IN THE MIDDLE OF AFOREMENTIONED AREA, BUT
THE RESULTS AREN'T TOO SPECTACULAR. IN OTHER WORDS, IT'S A
ROUGH DESERT. THE PURPLISH SKY MIGHT REMIND OF SURICRASIA,
BUT THIS IS A VERY FAR CRY.
19.65 - QUITE A CHANGE OF SCENERY. A ROLLING TERRAIN WITH
WATER ALL AROUND AND LOTS, LOTS OF TREES. THE LATTER ARE
BRIGHT GREEN AND MAKE A PECULIAR CONTRAST WITH THE STILL
PURPLISH SKY AND BROWN HILLS BLOCKING THE HORIZON.
148.55: SUNRISE? YES, SIR! AND IN A SPLENDID, DEEP, DARK
REDDISH COLOUR. OVERALL, THE SECTOR IS SIMILAR TO THE
PREVIOUS ONE. AGAIN HEAPS OF TREES, AND YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT
THE MENTIONED CONTRAST WAS EVEN MORE NOTICEABLE HERE.
358.29: THE SKY'S COLOUR, BROWN, MAKES IT LOOK HEAVY, ALMOST
AS IF IT WERE TO CRUMBLE AND FALL ON YOUR HEAD. THE FACT
THAT THIS PLACE IS A LIFELESS DESERT DOESN'T HELP EITHER.
A DISTURBING PLACE.
280.24: FOR A FAREWELL PHOTO, I WANTED A SUNSET IN THE
TROPICS, AND ENDED UP AMONG THE FROST. BUT I CAN'T COMPLAIN
BECAUSE IT PRODUCED A SUPERB VISTA, A DARK ORANGE SKY GLOBE
OVER ICY DESOLATION. AMAZING. SERPENS, 6011 787.520
ANOTHER PINKISH QUARTZ WORLD, THIS TIME WITH SEVERAL DARK
SPOTS, AND THIS MEANS MOUNTAINS. I'M NOT GOING DONW THERE
TO CHECK, THOUGH. SERPENS, 6011 787.521
A DARK LOOKING INTERNALLY HOT PLANET, WHERE NUMEROUS
VOLCANOES CONTRAST HIGHLY WITH THE MUCH DARKER, STILL
UNTOUCHED TERRAIN. SERPENS, 6011 787.521
AN IMPRESSIVE GAS GIANT, DARK GREEN, WITH THE USUAL BLACK
BELTS EVERYWHERE. ITS STORMS, HOWEVER, APPEAR TO BE
ANOMALOUS, BEING SOMEWHAT LARGER THAN ON OTHER GAS GIANTS
WHICH I'VE SEEN. REMEMBERING THEIR REAL SCALE, THEY ARE
TRULY HUMONGOUS. SERPENS, 6011 787.521
THIS IS INDEED A VERY CLOSE MOON, AND I'M INCLINED TO CALL
THIS LITTLE SYSTEM A DOUBLE PLANET. WHILE NONE OF ITS BODIES
ARE PARTICULARLY INTERESTING ON THEIR OWN, THE PLANET'S
RING CAN BE PERFECTLY SEEN FROM HERE, AND THE PAIR IS A
GREAT PHOTOGRAPHIC TARGET. SERPENS, 6011 787.522
AN ICY WORLD WITH A PRETTY, SPARKLING SURFACE, COLOURED
BRIGHTLY GREEN, WITH STREAKS CUTTING THROUGH IT, ALTHOUGH
THE LATTER ARE ALMOST INVISIBLE AMONG ALL THE BRIGHTNESS.
SERPENS, 6011 787.525
SMALL, SOLID AND FEATURELESS, BUT INDEED, THIS IS ONE QUICK
PIECE OF ROCK! I HAD TO INTERRUPT THE APPROACH AND START
IT OVER BECAUSE IT KEPT ESCAPING MY STARDRIFTER IN ITS
INITIAL COURSE. SERPENS, 6011 787.525
HEH, SLIGHTLY SLOWER THIS TIME. THIS IS AN ICY WORLD. ITS
SURFACE IS ALL SHADES OF BROWN, WHICH OVERALL IS SUPRISINGLY
PLEASANT TO THE EYE.THE USUAL STREAKS ARE NUMEROUS AND VERY
PROMINENT HERE. A FANTASTIC WORLD. SERPENS, 6011 787.526
MEDIUM-SIZED, SOLID, THICK ATMOSPHERE, BUT THESE WORDS WOULD
SUGGEST AN ORDINARY PLANET, WHILE THIS ONE IS DEFINITELY NOT
ONE! THE CLOUDS LOOK SPLENDID, COLOURED FROM PURPLISH TO
VIOLET, AND THERE ARE VERY LARGE, YELLOW STORMS AS WELL.
IT ALL RESEMBLES, I DON'T KNOW, A PAINTING MORE THAN A
PLANET, LIKE IT WAS HAND-DRAWN. IF YOU DECIDE TO LAND,
HOWEVER, THE SURFACE WILL PROBABLY GREET YOU WITH A RATHER
BLEAK SIGHT. SERPENS, 6011 787.526
THIS TIME, A SUBSTELLAR OBJECT. THE PREVIOUS OBJECTS ALL HAD
SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY TO THEM, AND THIS IS NO EXCEPTION.
BEING BRIGHT YELLOW AND PERFECTLY SMOOTH, IT'S LIKE A BALL
OF PURE GOLD. SERPENS, 6011 787.526
AH, YET ANOTHER STUNNING CELESTIAL BODY. THIS ONE IS A VERY
DARK GAS GIANT DECORATED WITH GOLDEN STORMS. THE CONTRAST
IS TRULY WONDERFUL. SERPENS, 6011 787.526
SMALL, SOLID, THIN ATMOSPHERE. SOMEWHAT SUPRISINGLY, THIS
PLANET ALSO IS RATHER UNUSUAL, TO BE MORE EXACT: IT'S
BRIGHTER THAN MOST OF ITS TYPE, WHILE ALSO HAVING MORE DARK,
WELL DEFINED AREAS THAN THE NORM WOULD SUGGEST. I TRIED
LANDING AND IT WAS EXTREMELY DARK, BUT WHAT LITTLE I COULD
SEE WAS A VAST PLAIN, WITH THE HORIZONS GLOWING EERILY.
SERPENS, 6011 787.527
VERY SIMILAR TO 7.7, IN FACT IT'S EVEN BRIGHTER. I WOULDN'T
LAND HERE THOUGH, I WERE UNABLE TO SEE ANYTHING.
FORTUNATELY, THE CUPOLA WAS GLITTERING SLIGHTLY AND I
MANAGED TO GET BACK ON THE STARDRIFTER. SERPENS, 6011 787.527
MEDIUM-SIZED, ROCKY, CREASED. HAS A PINKISH SURFACE WITH
MANY, MANY VERY DARK, IRREGULAR AREAS, PROBABLY DUSTY. I'LL
REMEMBER IT AS ONE OF THE MOST DEFINED OBJECTS OF ITS KIND.
SERPENS, 6011 787.527
SMALL, SOLID, ICY, THIS ONE IS ACTUALLY FAIRLY TYPICAL AS
FAR AS THESE WORLDS GO. GREENISH, WITH MANY STREAKS. AGAIN
THE 'REFINING' TOOK AGES AND I HAD TO APPROACH IT TWICE,
WHICH BROUGHT ME VERY CLOSE TO THE SURFACE. THE RESULTING
SIGHT WAS SPECTACULAR. SERPENS, 6011 787.527
A GAS GIANT. GREENISH COLOUR DOMINATES ITS CLOUDS, WHILE
THE NUMEROUS (MOSTLY RELATIVELY SMALL) STORMS ARE YELLOW.
I'VE SEEN QUITE A FEW SIMILAR GASEOUS PLANETS. I GUESS THE
FAT YEARS ARE OVER. SERPENS, 6011 787.527
SUBSTELLAR OBJECT, VERY MUCH ALIKE THE EARLIER SUBSTELLAR
OBJECT I DESCRIBED. A BALL OF GOLD, NO MORE, NO LESS.
SERPENS, 6011 787.527
I'D WRITE 'SEE 7,12', BUT THIS SUBSTELLAR OBJECT IS
BRIGHTER AND APPEARS TO BE QUITE CLOSE TO ANOTHER PLANET,
WHICH CAN BE CLEARLY SEEN AS A BRIGHT DOT IF YOU LOOK
AROUND. WELL, AT LEAST THAT'S HOW IT WAS ON MY ARRIVAL!
SERPENS, 6011 787.528
THIS IS THE FELISIAN ONE WHICH I MENTIONED IN NO.7'S NOTES.
QUITE GREEN, AT FIRST SIGHT THERE'S NOT MUCH WATER ON THE
SURFACE. STORMS, ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE QUITE NUMEROUS
AND VERY PROMINENT. DESCENDING NOW.
309.60: QUITE A LOT OF LIFE HERE, ACTUALLY! FIRST OF ALL,
MANY BUSHES OF GOLDEN COLOUR. I ALSO IMMEDIATELY SPOTTED
FIVE BIRDS IN THE SKY (THE COLOUR OF WHICH COULD ONLY
BARELY BE MADE OUT AS VERY DARK BLUE). BECAUSE THE PLANET
IS RATHER FAR FROM ITS STAR, NOT TO MENTION THE PRIMARY, IT
WAS RATHER SHADY DOWN THERE. WATER COULD BE SEEN AROUND,
WEIRDLY COLOURED FROM AFAR, BUT IT TURNED OUT TO BE
PLEASANTLY BLUE WHEN I TOOK A CLOSER LOOK.
307.28: THIS SECTOR WAS BASICALLY DIVIDED INTO TWO AREAS,
ONE OF WHICH WAS A LARGE HILL DOTTED WITH GREEN, DWARF
TREES, AND THE OTHER - A HALF-FLOODED PLAIN. THE SKY WAS
AGAIN QUITE DARK, MAYBE GREEN, MAYBE GREY, WHICH GAVE THE
PLACE A HEAVY, UNEASY ATMOSPHERE.
343.52: AH, SO DRAMATIC! I LANDED IN THE MIDDLE OF A
SECTION OF LAND SURROUNDED BY WATER AND COVERED BY
TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF TREES. THERE WAS A STORM AND FLASHES
BRIGHTENED THE SKY ALL THE TIME. A CRATER-LIKE FEATURE
COULD BE MADE OUT FROM THE CUPOLA. THERE'S SOMETHING
PECULIAR ABOUT THIS PLANET. ITS STRANGE ATMOSPHERE KEEPS
SUGGESTING THAT IT'S DYING, WHILE EVERYTHING ELSE POINTS TO
A RADICALLY DIFFERENT SITUATION. IN FACT, IT'S THE MOST
LUSH PLANET I'VE SEEN IN SOME TIME.
324.8: THE ICY AREAS OF THIS INTERESTING PLANET TURNED OUT
TO BE MUCH BRIGHTER THAN THE REST. I FOUND A PRETTY FROZEN
LAKE AND TOOK MY FAREWELL PHOTO THERE. SERPENS, 6011 787.529
MEDIUM-SIZED, SOLID, OXYGEN ATMOSPHERE, QUARTZ SURFACE.
BRIGHT. I CAN'T TELL WHETHER IT'S BROWN OR ORANGE... WELL,
PROBABLY BOTH. SERPENS, 6011 787.529
SMALL, SOLID, CRATERIZED. RATHER BRIGHT, ORANGE, WITH
SOME LARGE CRATERS. IT'S VERY FAST, AGAIN A SMOOTH APPROACH
WAS IMPOSSIBLE, AND WHEN FINALLY IN ORBIT, THE STARDRIFTER
SIMPLY COULDN'T KEEP UP! THIS RESULTED IN VERY STRANGE
BEHAVIOR, LIKE COMING DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO THE SURFACE,
THEN STRAYING AWAY TO DOUBLE NORMAL DISTANCE. THE ORBIT
WASN'T SMOOTH EITHER, MY 'DRIFTER CONSTANTLY NEEDED TO
CORRECT ITS COURSE AND POSITION BY SHORT, FAST THRUSTS.
I MANAGED TO DOCUMENT ONE VERY CLOSE APPROACH BY A
PHOTOGRAPH. SERPENS, 6011 787.530
MEDIUM-SIZED, SOLID, THICK ATMOSPHERE. THE CLOUD COLOURS
VARY FROM ORANGE TO BROWN (THESE SEEM TO BE QUITE POPULAR
IN THIS SYSTEM). ONE FAIRLY LARGE STORM AROUND THE NORTH
POLE, ONE CONSIDERABLY SMALLER IN THE VICINITY OF SOUTH
POLE. NOTHING ELSE NOTED. SERPENS, 6011 787.530
ADDITION BY SERPENS: OH, AND BY THE WAY, THIS WAS THE LAST
OBJECT OF THIS SYSTEM! NOW TO REFUEL, TAKE A REST, AND
FIND MYSELF ANOTHER TARGET. SERPENS, 6011 787.530
DISCOVERED BY S151. HAS VERY HIGH CONTRAST SPOTS.

LIFE BEARING PLANET WITH OXYGEN ATMOSPEHERE. LIQUID WATER OCEANS
LIFE MOSTLY CONSISTS OF INSECTS, SOME MAMMALS. DENSE VEGETATION.
GEOLOGIC FEATURES INCLUDE TALL ROLLING HILLS.
INTERESTINGLY, PLANET IS CONSTANTLY COVERED WITH AT LEAST ....
...10 HURRICANE-STYLE THUNDERSTORMS.
INTERESTING...THE DAYTIME TEMPERATURE IS ONLY +4-5 C.
PROBABLY NEED TO REAVALUATE THE POSSIBILITY OF LIQUID WATER OCEAN
MAYBE A HIGH SALT CONTENT IS KEEPING THE OCEANS LIQUID.
I WISH I COULD ANALYZE THE CHEMICAL CONTENT OF THE OCEAN FURTHER.
I STOOD ATOP A MOUNTAIN ALONE
AND I STARED INTO THE BLUENESS OF DESOLATION

NORTH POLE, 329:4. IN THE SOURTHERN AREA OF THIS QUADRANT, THERE IS AN
IMPRESSIVE ICEBERG SPRINGING FROM THE FROZEN WATERS. WORTHS A VISIT!
ICEBERG DISCOVERED BY ALEX GHIGNOLA, EPOC 6011:557.659
I HAVE DISCOVERED WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE THE REMAINS OF THE BRAXIS
SYNDICATE'S MAIN COMPLEX AT 19,41:-48,-5. THE LOCATION FITS MY
MEMORIES OF THE AREA, THOUGH THE GROUND LEVEL DOES SEEM TO HAVE RISEN
SLIGHTLY. IF INVESTIGATING THIS AREA, HOWEVER, REMEMBER TO BE CAREFUL
AROUND THE FRONTAL CLIFF-FACE OF THE VALLEY I BELIEVE TO BE RACKLIS
VALLEY, WHICH IS A DROP THAT WILL SERIOUSLY TEST THE ADAGE THAT A
FELISIAN ALWAYS LANDS ON HIS FEET.

HAS BEEN COVERED OVER BY PLANTS WITHOUT MAINTAINENCE. I WOULD EVEN BE
SO BOLD AS TO SAY IT WAS THE CAPITAL CITY OF A COUNTRY.

SKINNYMON EPOC 6011 569.336
I CAME HERE JUST TO MAKE SURE, AND I WAS RIGHT. THE WHITE CAT-LIKE
CREATURES, I HAVE DISCOVERED ON HA-KARI PLANET IN THE D'HARGA SYSTEM,
LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE THE CATS YOU CAN MEET ON FELYSIA. THE ONLY EXEPTION
IS THE COLOUR OF THEIR FUR. IF THE THEORY THAT THOSE CREATURES ON THE
FELYSIA PLANET ARE OUR DEGENERATED DESTENDANTS IS RIGHT, THEN I DARE
SAY, THAT SO ARE THE CREATURES FROM HA-KARI PLANET. THAT WOULD MEAN,
THAT THERE USED TO BE A FELYSIAN COLONY IN D'HARGA SYSTEM. BUT THERE
SEEM TO BE NO REMAINS OF IT LEFT. OR MAYBE THE HA-KARIANS AND FELYSIAN
RACE HAVE A COMMON ANCESTOR? THEESE ARE ONLY THEORIES, OF COURSE, BUT
I THINK THAT WE SHOULD LOOK FOR MORE PLANETS INHABITED BY CREATURES
SIMILIAR TO THE HA-KARI CATS. THAT COULD GIVE US SOME IDEA OF WHAT
HAVE HAPPENED TO THE REST OF FELYSIANS. (NOTE BY MRUQE; 6011-570-487)

A HOPPER SHOULD VISIT THIS PLACE. (MURRMURR 6011:602.711)
UPON VISITING THE AREA ALONG THE 312 LINE, I HAVE A NEW IDEA.
INSTEAD OF BEING DOMED CITIES, THESE LARGE HOLES ARE REMINISCENT OF
MASS BURIAL MOUNDS. MY LANDER CAME DOWN ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE RIDGE
UPON CLIMBING AND VIEWING THE AREA FROM ABOVE, IT SEEMS CLEAR FROM THE
PRECISE ORIENTATIONS OF THE PYRAMID MOUNDS THAT THERE IS SOME SORT OF
RITUAL SIGNIFICANCE. THIS MIGHT ALSO EXPLAIN WHY THE AREAS ARE DUG
INTO THE GROUND, INSTEAD OF BEING ON THE SURFACE.

SERPENS, 6011 665.331
WHERE HAVE ALL THE CATGIRLS GONE? WHAT HAPPEND ONE EPOCH AGO?
FURTHER NOTES:FOUND TWO LARGE CUBE LIKE THINGS, AT 115,44 LANDER LANDS
ON TOP OF IT. NICE VIEVS ON THE OTHER CUBE FROM TOP. JUMING OFF WAS
FUN. TEMP. ON GROUND LEVEL WAS -5 DEGREES, AND ON TOP OF THE CUBE
THE THEMP. WAS -15.5 DERGEES. SEEN A HOPPER JUMPING OFF THE CUBE.
NOTES BY MCWGOGS, EPOC 6011.647.618.
FOUND LOTS OF INTERESTING ARCHITECTURE AT 310:60. THIS AREA IS TEEMING
WITH WILDLIFE. FOUND WHAT APPEARED TO BE A ROAD IN THE DISTANCE.

LAST 3 NOTES BY BLADE TRAIN3R 6011 705.161
EPOC 6011, ARCHEOS' JOURNAL. I'VE BEEN AT THE MYSTERIUOS CUBE LIKE
FACILITYAT 86.74, ITS FASCINATING TO SEE HOW THE STRANGE CAT CREATURES
MOVE IN THE ZONE. BEWARE THE CENTRAL AREA, NOT FAR FROM THE LANDING
POINT, FALLING THERE MEANS TROUBLE TO COME BACK.
ARCHEOS, EPOC 6011
I FOUND A SEA AT 175.50 IN MY FIRST VISIT TO OUR HOMEWORLD.
AT 175.51 IS AN ISLAND (?), FEW LIFEFORMS, MANY SMALL PONDS. LOOKS
REAALY NICE! I INTEND TO XPLORE THE SEA AROUND, LATER...
AT 174.50: -77.46 LARGE COMPLEX BY SIDE OF A HILL-CITY? SOME BASE?...
(NOTES BY CATRANGER, EPOC 6011: 717.697)
A HUGE CUBE DISC AT 48.50. PLACE LIKE ISLAND...BUT LARGE ONE.
IT IS A PLATEAU,HEAVILY FORESTED BUT POORLY INHABITED-JUST BIRDS AND
A PAIR OF HORNED MAMMALS.THE CUBE MIGHT BE AN OLD HOUSELIKE STRUCTURE
AS WAS ONCE SUGGESTEDBY OTHERS.I DO NOT KNOW WHY THEY BUILT IT THOUGH
INSTEAD OF DIGGING INTO THE LARGE HILLY PLATEAU NEARBY...
BUT MAYBE THEY DID FIRST,CAUSE I FOUND A HUGE SQUARE PIT-UNDER FLOOD.
MAYBE THAT IS WHY THEY LEFT THEIR FLOODED CITIES UNDERGROUND AND BUILT
THE CUBES.I HEARD OF SUCH STRUCTURES ELSEWHERE...
NOTES BY CATRANGER, EPOC 6011,717.702
I HAVE BEEN REVIEWING THE TEXT THAT AMWHERE HAD ENTERED AND I HAVE
AN IDEA ABOUT THE AMZINGLY HUGE SQUARE HOLES... I THINK THAT THEY
WERE MINES BECAUSE THEY SAY THE STARDRIFTERS ARE MADE OUT OF
QUARTZ. SO IM THINKING THAT AFTER OUR ANCESTORS INCINERATED THE MOON
FROM ALL THE MINING THEY WENTFOR THE PLANET AND MINED ALL THE QUARTZ
TO MAKE THE STARDRIFTERS. SO THERE FOR I THINK THEHOLES ARE MINES THEY
LOOK ABOUT THE SAME SIZE OF THE SHIPS.
ALSO I ACTULLY CAUGHT A BIRDIT WAS SO COOL. IM FINDING MY ANCETERAL
INTINCTS.
359.96 - A GOOD PLACE FOR A QUICK SNACK. BEAUTIFUL SURROUNDINGS, TOO.
LANDED AT LQ 229:072 AND FOUND TWO DOUBLE-ROWS OF PYRAMIDS. GOING TO
-16.-11, YOU CAN LOOK TO THE NORTH AND WEST AND SEE THEM. YOU CAN ALSO
SEE THEM ON DESCENT (NOTES BY DAWIWO, EPOCH 6011:768.511)
LQ 160:092 IS A WONDERFUL SPOT! THE WEATHER WAS PERFECT WITH A FEW
CLOUDS. IT WAS HIGHLY DEVELOPED IN THE PAST APPARENTLY AND MAY HAVE
BEEN VERY GOOD FOR CROPS. THE LAND IS COMPLETELY COVERED IN TALL GRASS
AND IF YOUR EYES ARE NOT USE TO SEEING SO MUCH MOVE AT ONCE, THEY MAY
TAKE SOME TIME TO GET USED TO IT -- BUT THE HUNTING WAS GOOD. GOT A
GOOD MEAL HERE. THERE IS A STRUCTURE, POSSIBLY AN OLD BUILDING AT
-65,-50 AND GIVES A GOOD VEW OF THE SURROUNDINGS. TO THE NW YOU CAN
FIND A VERY INTERESTING GROUND STRUCTURE. -41.-31 IS A GOOD PLACE TO
GET A VIEW OF THE AREA. THERE IS A DROP TO A BOWL-LIKE AREA BELOW. THE
OLD BUILDING AT 92.46 CAN BE CLIMBED, BUT IT MUST BE APPROACHED AT AN
ANGLE. THERE IS MORE TO SEE AROUND IT FROM THE TOP. THIS LOCATION AND
SURROUNDINGS ARE WORTH VISITING! (NOTES BY DAWIWO, EPOCH 6011:768.512)
IF THIS JOB EVER ENDS, OR FOR A FINAL RESTING PLACE, I WANT TO LIVE BY
92.56:41.55 - BEAUTIFUL BOWL WITH AN OPENING TO THE NORTH. WHERE IS
DREAMER? IT SHOULD BE RIGHT HERE AND DECORATE THE SKY FOR A SMALL VIEW
(NOTES BY DAWIWO, EPOCH 6011:768.513)
VISITED FELYSIA TODAY. SPARSE VEGITATION, SOME PLANTLIFE, AND
ION STORMS. WAS GLAD TO GET BACK TO POD.
FURTHER NOTES: SMALL, SOLID, DUSTY, CRATERIZED, NO ATMOSPHERE.
LARGE CRATERS, ONE APPEARS TO BE INSIDE ANOTHER. VERY CLOSE TO ITS
MOON, RADHARPHIS. SKINNYMON EPOC 6011 568.470
FURTHER NOTES:I'VE FOUND THAT THIS PLANET IS SMALLER AND HAS LESS MASS
THAN IT'S MOON. YALADARPHIS GRAV.:0.277 FG. RADHARPIS GRAV.:0.307 FG.
NOTES BY MCWGOGS, EPOC 6011.647.616.
A WONDERFUL PLACE TO VIEW ITS PLANET, FAL GALMATRIFAL, FROM.
A DIRTY ROCK-ICE MOON, THE AREA 332.081 HOLDS LITTLE MORE
THAN SOME INTERESTING MOUNTAINS AND SPIRES TOPPED WITH ICE.
ENTRY BY KONNRAD. EPOCH 6011:560.688
FURTHER NOTES:SMALL, SOLID, DUSTY, CRATERIZED, NO ATMOSPHERE.
THE PECULIAR NATURE OF THIS MOON IS THE HIGHLY REFLECTIVE CRATERS
AND THE DARK COLORED 'RAYS' FROM THE IMPACTS AS SEEN FROM ORBIT.
SKINNYMON EPOC 6011 568.285
FURTHER NOTES:FOUND A HOLE AT 320.30:26,-25, THAT APPEARS TO BE A FRESH
IMPACT CRATER. CENTRAL PEAKS IN THE CENTER, BRIGHT VOILET ROCKS ALL OVER.
( NOTES BY MCWGOGS EPOC 6011.646.955 )
FURTHER NOTES: SMALL, SOLID, THIN ATMOSPHERE, ALMOST DARK BUT SOME
MARKINGS ARE VISIBLE FROM ORBIT. POLAR CAPS QUITE BRIGHT.
SKINNYMON EPOC 6011 568.285
ALTHOUGH ICE CAPS ARE EVIDENT FROM ORBITAL EXAMINATION, UPON
LANDING I WAS UNABLE TO LOCATE ANY ACTUAL ICE.
I TRIED THREE DIFFERENT LANDING SITES TO NO AVAIL.
(NOTE BY DFARAN LENIARC EPOC 6011:674.237)
FURTHER NOTES: MEDIUM SIZED, SOLID, THICK ATMOSPHERE, COVERED BY
CLOUDS. NOT AN ATTRACTIVE WORLD, RATHER DARK WITH A COUPLE OF

A BEAUTIFUL DARK BLUE HAZE CREATE WHITE DISTORSION EFFECT ON THE
HORIZON (FELIX, 6011:568.678)
AT 19.57 39.20 AN ENORMOUS HOLE/CRATER WAS DISCOVERED.
I MANAGED TO FALL DOWN THERE, TWICE. NOT RECOMMENDED!
NOTES BY DORIAN. EPOC 6011:609.214
FURTHER NOTES: MEDIUM SIZED, INTERNALLY HOT, UNSTABLE SURFACE,
NO ATMOSPHERE. ISN'T THIS THE WORLD THAT ON WHICH, AS THE OLD
JOKE GOES, THEY HAVE BEACHFRONT PROPERTY TO SELL YOU?
SKINNYMON EPOC 6011 568.286
FURTHER NOTES: SMALL, SOLID, THIN ATMOSPHERE, MOSTLY DARK BUT A
FEW LIGHTER AREAS, INCLUDING A POSSIBLE CRATER, NOTED FROM ORBIT.
POLAR CAPS GOOD. SKINNYMON EPOC 6011 568.382
FURTHER NOTES: SMALL, SOLID, THIN ATMOSPHERE, DIMLY ABLE TO SEE
MANY SURFACE MARKINGS, INCLUDING MANY LIGHT SPOTS, GOOD POLAR
CAPS. SKINNYMON EPOC 6011 568.383
DID YOU TRY LANDING ON CERYNUYA? THE SURFACE MAY EXPLAIN WHY THIS MOON IS
SO BRIGHT WHEN SEEN FROM SPACE. CERYNUYA HAS TRANSPARENT SURFACE.
PROBABLY, IT'S MADE OF PURE ICE, FOR SOME REASON, THE MOON MUST BE
PROTECTED FROM SPACE DUST. PERHAPS IT'S BECAUSE THE OTHER MOONS THROW
DUST AWAY WITH THEIR GRAVITY.
NOTES WRITTEN BY ALEX GHIGNOLA, EPOC 6011:557.659
FURTHER NOTES: SMALL, SOLID DUSTY (THAT'S THE OFFICIAL DESCRIPTION,
AND I'M STICKING TO IT), CRATERIZED, NO ATMOSPHERE. ITS HIGHLY
REFLECTIVE SURFACE MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO MAKE OUR DETAILS OTHER THAN
A FEW CRATERS FROM ORBIT. THE TRANSPARENCY EFFECT WORKED BEST WHEN I
MANAGED TO GET A RIDGE BETWEEN ME AND MY CAPSULE.
SKINNYMON EPOC 6011 568.383
FURTHER NOTES: MEDIUM SIZED, SOLID, THICK ATMOSPHERE, COVERED BY
CLOUDS. A COUPLE OF NICE STORMS BREWING.

SKINNYMON EPOC 6011 568.385
FURTHER NOTES: MEDIUM SIZED, SURFACE IS MAINLY NATIVE QUARTZ,
OXYGEN ATMOSPHERE. INTERESTING APPEARANCE FROM ORBIT: IT HAS MANY
LIGHT PATCHES, BUT YOU CAN SEE THEM ON THE DARK SIDE OF THE
WORLD. SKINNYMON EPOC 6011 568.385
FURTHER NOTES: MEDIUM SIZED, ROCKY, CREASED, NO ATMOSPHERE. LOOKS
PRETTY ROUGH WITH SOME SCARRING FROM ORBIT. ONLY A VERY BRAVE OR
NOT SO BRIGHT STARDRIFTER WOULD ATTEMPT A LANDING AFTER SEEING IT.
I'M NEITHER. SKINNYMON EPOC 6011 568.368
FURTHER NOTES: SMALL, SOLID, DUSTY, CRATERIZED, NO ATMOSPHERE.
LOTS AND LOTS OF NICE CRATERS. PROBABLY LOTS AND LOTS OF NICE
PLACES TO GET LOST IN. SKINNYMON EPOC 6011 568.386
THIS IS ONE OF THE MOONS FELYSIAFORMED AFTER EPOCH 4112.
THE OTHER WAS VERICALYA.
FURTHER NOTES: CHOPPED, FORMED AND PROCESSED, JUST THE WAY THE
GODS LIKED IT. AT 278.60 I FOUND AN ISLAND WITH A ROUNDED HILL
AND SHRUBS, NOT MUCH ELSE. 277.54 HAS A HILLY, THICK FOREST. AT
267.43 THERE'S SCRUBBY PLANTS AND ANOTHER ROUNDED HILL. I FIRST
STARTED SPOTTING BIRDS HERE. AT 246,43 THERE'S ANOTHER FOREST. AT
229.95 I LANDED NEAR A MARSHY AREA, COMPLETE WITH A HOPPER TO
GREET ME AND SHRUBS. I SPOTTED SOMETHING IN THE
DISTANCE ON MY DESCENT, I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT IS, BUT IT HAD A
DIFFERENT LOOK TO IT. ON MY WAY TO INVESTIGATE II STARTED TO COME
ACROSS WHAT APPEARED TO BE A CHASM OF SOME KIND, AND KNOWING HOW I
HATE TO CLIMB OUT OF THINGS LIKE THAT, I TURNED BACK. SOMEONE ELSE
CAN INVESTIGATE. SKINNYMON EPOC 6011 568.390
A MOON WITH WILD LIFE, BEAUTIFUL GREEN TREES! LAND AT 21.59
ALSO, GO TO 29.18, YOU'LL FIND GIANT RABBITS WITH TAILS ON BLUE HILLS,

BORDERING THE CANYON AT 229.95 IS A FOUR LEGGED SPIRE.
UNLIKE OTHERS I'VE SEEN, THIS ONE HAS A LEG RUNNING INTO THE CANYON
ALL THE WAY TO THE WATER BELOW. COULD THIS BE PART OF THE FELISAFORMING
BUILDINGS? AMWHERE 6011.572.368
FOUND A TRICHORDITE STRUCTURE AT 230.95 ON EXPLORATION OF AREA
SURROUNDING 229.95 FOR PREV. EXPLORER'S STRUCTURE. DID NOT FIND
ANY STRUCTURES IN 229.95 BUT FOUND WHAT SEEMED TO BE A LARGE WALL.
(NOTES BY JIM GAMMA EPOC 6011 594.424)
FOUND A (WET) SUNKEN FORT AT 228.95 AND THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT
WALL. ALSO FOUND A PILLAR IN THE SEA... A MONUMENT?... AND A
LARGE BUILDING I DIDN'T INVESTIGATE. 229.96 IS WATER.
(JIM GAMMA EPOC 6011:594.425)
ANOTHER TRICHORDATE BUILDING AT 229.94 - AM SEEING A PATTERN.
YET ANOTHER AT 230.94 PLUS WHAT SEEMS TO BE A DOMED CITY.
A DRYER FORT AT 228.96 PLUS A QUARTZ MOUND IN THE SEA, BUT DIDN'T
SWIM OUT TO THIS. (JIM GAMMA 6011:594.426)
136.64 IS IN THE MIDDLE OF A LARGE BODY OF WATER. NEARBY ARE
RECTANGULAR PROMITORIES TO GET UP AND HAVE A VIEW. THERE IS AN
ODD ATMOSPHERIC EFFECT WHEN TRAVELLING AT HIGH SPEED IN THE WATER
A SEARCHLIGHT PATTERN RESOLVES ITSELF IN THE SKY - HOWEVER,
FOLLOWING IT WILL NOT LEAD YOU ANYWHERE. AN INTERACTION BETWEEN
OUR PROTECTIVE SHIELDS AND THE WATER AND AIR?

EVEN THOUGH IT APPEARS TO BE ROCKY
LOOKING AT 23:60, THE TEXTURE IS QUITE SIMILAR, POSSIBLY SUGGESTING
THAT THIS PLANET WAS FORMED IN MANNERS UNUSUAL.
TREES ARE SPARCE, AND NOT CLUSTERED. BODIES OF WATER ARE OFTEN SEEN,
AS WITH MOST FELISIAN PLANETS. EXPLORATION OF THESE IS CURRENTLY
NOT POSSIBLE DUE TO THE RESTRICTION OF THE TETHER.

AH, SWEET NITROGEN. MY SECONDARY LUNGS HAVE BEEN ACHING FOR A WHILE
I FEEL BETTER NOW.
MY... HOW... INTRUIGING....
I HAVE BEEN TO MANY PLANETS AND HAV LANDED ON MANY ISLANDS BEFORE, BUT
THIS PLANET IS DIFFERENT.
IT HAS A STRANGELY CALM FEELIAURA....
THE ISLAND I LANDED ON, THOUGH NOT UNLIKE MANY OF THE OTHERS I'VE BEEN
TO, WAS MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN ALL OF THEM. I DON'T KNOW WHY THAT IS...
MY LANDING POINT WAS 56.93
EXPLORE IT FOR YOURSELF...
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE I'VE SEEN A PLANET LIKE THIS ONE.
I REMEMBER SPOTTING THEM ALL THE TIME WHEN I FIRST STARTED OUT.
SMALL, SOLID, DUSTY, CRATERIZED. GREEN, TRUE, BUT AT THE SAME TIME
IT LOOKS VERY INTERESTING. NOTABLY, THE CRATERS ARE WONDERFUL,
BEING SO PROMINENT WITH THEIR SIZE AND RAYS OF EJCECTA, AND
CONTRASTING WITH THE PLAINY OR MOUNTAINOUS AREAS. THE PLANET
OFFERS A SPLENDID MIX OF COLOURS AND SHADES. OF COURSE, IF YOU
DON'T LIKE DARKNESS, DO NOT LAND, EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT TOO
DIFFICULT TO FIND YOUR WAY USING THE BROWN DWARF'S DISK AS A
GUIDANCE POINT. SERPENS, 6011 788.196
ANOTHER PLANET OF THE SAME TYPE - SMALL, CRATERIZED ETC. IT HAS A
DISTINCT PURPLE HUE, VERY PLEASANT TO LOOK AT. MANY CRATERS OF
VARIOUS SIZES, THOUGH NO REALLY HUGE ONES, SCAR ITS SURFACE. IT'S A
BEAUTIFUL PLANET. SHAME THAT IT'S SO DARK DOWN THERE, BUT LANDING
IN THE MIDDLE OF A DARK CRATER, OR BETWEEN TWO LARGE HILLS, CAN
ALSO BE AN INTERESTING EXPERIENCE. SERPENS, 6011 788.197
WELL, SOME 'PLANETS' THEY WERE - ALL MORE LIKE ASTEROIDS. BUT
STILL, I SHOULDN'T COMPLAIN, THEY ARE ALL BEAUTIFUL. THIS IS
ANOTHER WORLD OF THE SAME CLASS. HAS A GREENISH COLOUR, BUT
DIFFERENT THAN THE USUAL ONE. MANY SMALL, REFLECTIVE AREAS WHICH
ARE ACTUALLY PINK! ONE FEATURE OF NOTE IS A DOUBLE CRATER - THAT
IS, A SMALLER CRATER INSIDE A LARGER ONE. ALL THE BIGGER ONES

LANDED ON 26:21. SHORELINE WITH BIRDS AND FAIRLY LARGE HOPPERS.
THE GROUND WAS BROWN AND THE WATER WAS BLUE-PINK. THERE WERE
SOME YELLOW BUSHES. NOT HILLY, FAIRLY FLAT. TEMPERATURE WAS
ABOUT 10 CELCIUS. --EKA
163:70. DRY, SMALL BUMPY HILLS, NO VEGETATION OR ANIMAL LIFE TO
BE SEEN. --EKA
156:34. LANDED IN A RAINSTORM. IT WAS ALONG A COASTLINE. MUCH
LIKE THE FIRST LANDING, BUT THIS TIME I SAW A LARGISH LOOKING
HILL TO THE WEST. SO I RAN OVER THERE AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE
A RATHER LARGE, STEEP MOUNTAIN WITH A FLAT AREA AT THE TOP WHERE
BIRDS WERE FLYING ABOUT. AS THIS PLANET HAS SLGHTLY SUB-NORMAL
GRAVITY, I HAD A GREAT TIME JUMPING OFF THE HILL.. VERY

IT HAS A VERY ODD LAND FORMATION..NOT IN THE USUAL CONTINENT
STYLE BUT LIKE SOME SORT OF STRANGE SWIRL. IT'S HARD TO
DESCRIBE. I'M GOING IN. --EKA
70:35.. THIS IS A NICE PLANET. EVERYTHING WAS BRIGHT GREEN.. THE
WATER, THE GRASS, THE BUSHES. THE TEMPERATURE WAS 30 CELCIUS
AND THE GRAVITY WAS ONLY 60% THAT OF FELISIAN GRAVITY. LANDED ON
A COASTLINE AND SAW A COUPLE OF ISLANDS. SO I SWAM TO ONE ISLAND
..THAT ONE WAS RATHER SMALL. WHEN I SWAM TO THE OTHER ISLAND I
SAW TRANSPARENT TREES! I'VE ONLY SEEN THESE ON ONE OTHER
FELISIAN PLANET.. THEY'RE QUITE MARVELOUS. ANYWAY, THE PLANET
ITSELF IS FAIRLY FLAT BUT HAS VAST, LOW HILLS. OR THE PLACE I
WENT TO, ANYWAY. I'M GOING TO LAND UP NORTH TO GET A PLACE THAT
ISN'T SO HOT. --EKA
54:25... IT WAS STILL 25 C OR SO. NOT MUCH DIFFERENT HERE THAN
IT WAS AT THE FIRST AREA. --EKA
231:119, THE SOUTH POLE.. OR AS CLOSE AS I COULD GET. ALL OF A
SUDDEN, INSTEAD OF A GREEN WORLD, I SAW A BLUE ONE -- WITH ICY
MOUNTAINS AND ICY LAKES. THERE WERE BIRDS, HOPPERS, AND CRAWLERS
THOUGH NOT ALL THAT MANY. I WAS WANDERING AROUND, CLIMBING A
LARGE HILL, WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN I SEE BELOW ME A LARGE CRATER!
THE BOTTOM OF THE CRATER WAS AN ICY POND. I WENT OFF TO A NEARBY
HILL AND SAW THAT THE AREA I WAS SCALING WAS A LARGE HILL WITH
TWO NEIGHBORING CRATERS! I WENT OVER TO THE CENTER; THE SMALL
'BRIDGE' BETWEEN THEM.. THE LOCATION OF WHICH IS ABOUT -30, -55.
THE LARGER CRATER WAS THE ONE I HAD STUMBLED INTO, BUT THERE WAS
ALSO A SMALLER ONE NEARBY. I SUGGEST VISITING THESE TWIN CRATERS
AS IT'S QUITE MARVELLOUS. --EKA

I WANTED TO USE THE NAME ODDBALL, BUT IT WAS TAKEN. ANYWAY, THIS IS A
BROWN DWARF WITH A VERY TILTED AXIS AND A THICK LINE OF CLOSE-IN RINGS. IT

A FELISIAN MOON OF 'ODD' ON EKA75. VERY LITTLE WATER; JUST A FEW LAKES.
I'M GOING IN. --EKA
15:72. LANDED IN A HILLY, GRASSY AREA. SAW ONLY PLANT LIFE. I WENT EAST
AND CAME UPON SOME LARGE CRATER-LIKE AREAS WITH SMALL PONDS INSIDE
THEM. THE INTERESTING THING WAS THAT THE PONDS HAD TREES GROWING OUT OF
THEM. I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. I MIGHT EXPLORE THIS PLANET A
BIT MORE LATER. --EKA
FURTHER NOTES: THE TEMPERATURE WAS AROUND 0-10 C, THE GRAVITY WAS ABOUT
.8 FG, AND THE ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE WAS AROUND 1.3 ATM. --EKA
A TEAL-GREEN MOON OF 'ODD' ON EKA75. VERY SMOOTH, CALM APPEARANCE.
IT IS OF THE CLOUD-COVERED TYPE. --EKA
THIS MOON IS CLOSE TO IDENTICAL TO 'THIRST'. THEY BOTH ORBIT THE
BROWN DWARF 'ODD' ON THE STAR EKA75. THIS STAR HARBORS ANOTHER SET
OF TWIN MOONS, NAMELY 'OLD GUM' AND 'MORE OLD GUM'. THE PLANETS
'THIRST' AND 'MORE THIRST' ARE BOTH FELISIAN PLANETS WITH MOSTLY
LAND AND VERY LITTLE WATER; JUST A FEW LAKES. --EKA
A CLOUD-COVERED MOON THAT LOOKS REMARKABLY LIKE A GAS GIANT BY THE
CLOUD FORMATIONS AND TEXTURES. IT ORBITS 'ODD' ON EKA75, WHICH HAS
PROVEN TO HAVE SOME ODD MOONS. --EKA
THIS GAS GIANT ORBITS THE BROWN DWARF 'ODD' ON EKA75. THE
REASON I CHOSE THIS NAME IS THAT THE PREVIOUS MOON OF 'ODD'
IS A CLOUD-COVERED MOON THAT LOOKS LIKE A GAS GIANT - I NAMED
IT 'IMPOSTER'. THIS ONE IS ACTUALLY A GAS GIANT. AS FAR AS GAS
GIANTS GO, THIS ONE IS VERY NICE-LOOKING AND UNUSUAL. I SUGGEST
A VISIT AS THIS STAR HAS QUITE A FEW OTHER INTERESTING THINGS
TO SEE, AS WELL. --EKA

AN INTERNALLY HOT MOON OF 'FARAWAY HOPE' ON EKA75. --EKA
A FELISIAN MOON OF 'FARAWAY HOPE' ON EKA75. GREEN IN COLOR, ABOUT
60% OCEAN AND 40% LAND. GREEN COLOR. THIS ORBITS A VERY FAR AWAY
PLANET (IN RELATION TO THE SUN), SO I AM CURIOUS AS TO THE LIFE
HERE... OR LACK THEREOF. I'M GOING IN. --EKA
62:57. LANDED ON AN ISLAND. THE GRAVITY WAS VERY LOW, AT ONLY
.675 FG, AS WAS THE ATMOSPERIC PRESSURE, AT .7 OR SO. IT WAS
TEMPARATE, AT AROUND 10 CELCIUS, AND I SAW A BIRD FLYING. THERE
WAS A LARGE AMOUNT OF PLANT LIFE. IN ADDITION, THIS IS ONE OF THE
THREE FELISIAN PLANETS/MOONS I'VE SEEN THAT HAVE TRANSPARENT
TREES. NOT A COMMON OCCURENCE BY ANY MEANS, SO I SUGGEST A VISIT
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED. --EKA
A MORBID-LOOKING GREY CRATERED MOON. THIS IS THE LAST MOON OF
THE LAST PLANET OF THE EKA75 STAR. IT ORBITS 'FARAWAY HOPE'.
DESPITE THE UNHAPPY MOOD IT SETS, IT DOES LOOK RATHER NICE.
WORTH A VISIT, CONSIDERING THAT THE FELISIAN MOON OF THE SAME
PLANET HAS TRANSPARENT TREES. THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE IS PRETTY
INTERESTING. --EKA

SMALL, SOLID, DUSTY, CRATERIZED, NO ATMOSPHERE, THE TYPICAL PLANET
OF A S05 SYSTEM. IT'S THE FIRST PLANET, BUT IT'S DARKER THAN THE
FARTHER OUT *FELISIAN* WORLD OF BROWN LIFE, WHICH IS WHY I CALLED
IT ULTRAGREEN, IT'S BRIGHT GREEN FROM ORBIT, BUT PITCH, PITCH BLACK
WHEN YOU LAND, LIKE SEEING ULTRAVOILET. DON'T STRAY TOO FAR FROM
YOUR LANDER OR YOU'LL GET LOST!

I'VE YET TO FIND HOPPERS OR BIRDS. NOTHING ARTIFICIAL EITHER,
THOUGH I DID FIND A CRATER AT 137:59. IT'S VERY DARK HERE, MOST OF
THE LIGHT IS IN INFRARED, SO I CAN'T SEE MUCH.
I FINALLY FOUND A COUPLE BIRDS, WHICH IS ENOUGH FOR ME, SEE IF YOU
CAN FIND SOME HOPPERS. I'LL GIVE YOU THE COORDINATES FOR THIS WORLD
FOR IT MIGHT BE TOO FAR OUT FOR YOUR PAR COMMAND:
PARSIS: 172101;3084692;6978311. THE STAR IS CALLED LUCKY.
ALSO, EVEN THOUGH IT IS THE THIRD AND FARTHEST PLANET FROM THE
SUN, ITS SURFACE IS BRIGHTER AND EASIER TO SEE.
IT ALSO HAS A SMALL ICY MOON WITH NO ATMOSPHERE.

SMALL, SOLID, DUSTY, NO ATMOSPHERE, SOME LARGE CRATERS, GREY
APPEARANCE. THE SURFACE TEMPERATURE WAS ALMOST 580 CELSIUS.
THE STAR WAS LOOKING IMPRESSIVE FROM SURFACE. SERPENS,
6011 665.933
A FELISIAN WORLD. BEAUTIFUL, DEEP BLUE TO VIOLET COLOUR. THE
LAND-WATER PROPORTIONS SEEM TO BE RATHER BALANCED. THE PLANET IS
STILL CLOSE TO THE MAIN STAR. HAS THREE MOONS.
311.60 - LANDED IN THE MIDDLE OF DENSE EQUATORIAL FOREST.
TEMPERATURE WAS VERY HIGH, REACHING 38 CELSIUS AT LOWER ALTITUDES
. BOTH GRASS AND TREES WERE BEAUTIFUL, DEEP GREEN, THE SKY -
PURPLE. I'VE FOUND BOTH BIRDS AND HOPPERS, AND THE LATTER SEEMED
TO DO EVERYTHING TO MAKE ME ANGRY,,, NEVER MIND. THE FIRST LOOK
AT THIS PLANET WAS VERY GOOD - SEEMS IT'S TEEMING WITH LIFE.
THE LANDSCAPE IS BEAUTIFUL. I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE WATER!
354.63 - I'VE LANDED IN THE MIDDLE OF WATER BODY. AT THE
SOUTHWEST, THERE WAS A TINY ISLAND DOMINATED BY A HUGE MOUNTAIN.
WATER HAD A BEAUTIFUL BLUE COLOUR. ALL THIS TOOK PLACE DURING A
SUNSET AND A STORM. I'VE ALSO SPOTTED AQUATIC LIFE.
296.63 - ISLAND, MANY BUSHES. THERE'S A LARGE CHASM AT -9;-11
WITH A NICE POOL OF WATER AT THE VERY BOTTOM. LOOKS GREAT!
323.21 - SOME LAKES. WAY COLDER HERE, ABOUT 10 CELSIUS. BOTH
GROUND AND AVIAN LIFE PRESENT.
318.71 - LANDED NEAR THE SHORELINE. A LARGE CHASM, SOME LAKES AND
SMALL BAY FAR AHEAD. THE WATER WAS NICE AS SEEN FROM AFAR. MANY
BUSHES WERE PRESENT, AND I'VE SPOTTED MORE THAN FIVE BIRDS!
296.83 - ONLY WATER.
331.119 - TWO FROZEN LAKES, NOTHING SPECIAL OTHERWISE... WELL,
MAYBE EXCEPT THIS FAST, CAT-LIKE CREATURE - QUITE AN UNUSUAL
SIGHT AT THE POLE...
253.42 - MY LAST TRY. WONDERFUL COASTAL LANDSCAPE, LOTS OF LIVING
CREATURES. I REALLY LIKED THIS PLANET. IT HAS
BREATHTAKING FEATURES, IT'S TEEMING WITH LIFE AND REALLY WARM.
PERFECT HOLIDAY SPOT, I'D SAY! SERPENS, 6011 665.935
FELISIAN PLANET. I MUST SAY THAT I'VE EXPECTED THIS. IT ALSO HAS
THREE MOONS. THE OTHER NOTABLE THING IS A CLUSTER OF STORMS
GATHERED AT THE EQUATOR.
327.60 - ONLY WATER, BUT NICELY COLOURED. STRONG WINDS. EXCELLENT
TEMPERATURE.
330.44 - WATER AGAIN, BUT THIS TIME IN THE MIDDLE OF A LIGHTING
STORM. SPOTTED A BIRD-LIKE CREATURE.
37.62 - IN THE MEANTIME, I TOOK A LONG LOOK AT THE PLANET'S
SURFACE. IT TURNS OUT THAT IT'S DOMINATED WITH WATER. THIS ISLAND
IS DOTTED WITH LAKES, BUT, ON THE OTHER SIDE, HAS A DENSE FOREST
. THE LEAVES WERE NICE, ALMOST TEAL. ALSO SEEN A HOPPER AND BIRDS
. 333.37 - AGAIN, SOME LAKES AND LARGE FOREST. NICE LANDSCAPE.
337.73 - NOTHING PARTICULAR, BUT IT SEEMS THAT AROUND THESE
COORDINATES IS THE ONLY LARGE LANDMASS OF THIS PLANET. LOTS OF
HOPPERS, AND - ESPECIALLY - BIRDS. NICE, BLUE SKY.
4.1 - ONE FROZEN LAKE. NOTHING ELSE.
11.77 - MY LAST TRY, AND, SADLY - UNSUCCESFUL. NOTHING EXCEPT
WATER. STRONG WINDS... AND THAT'S ALL FOLKS.
OVERALL, THE PLANET TURNED OUT TO BE NICE, THOUGH NOT SO
BEAUTIFUL AS SERPENTINE 3
SERPENS, 6011 665.937
QUARTZ SURFACE, OXYGEN ATMOSPHERE. APPEARS GREEN FROM SPACE. NO
SPECTACULAR SURFACE FEATURES, BUT THE STAR SHINES REALLY BRIGHT
FROM HERE - TAKE A LOOK IF YOU WANT. SERPENS, 6011 665.937
A GAS GIANT. TWO MOONS SPOTTED FROM ORBIT. HAS A THIN RING, DARK
GREEN SURFACE AND PLENTY OF ATMOSPHERIC STORMS. SERPENS,
6011 665.938
THE SEVENTH PLANET OF SERPENTINE SYSTEM IS A FELISIAN WORLD -
THIS FAR AWAY FROM THE SUN! THERE STILL SEEM TO BE LARGE BODIE
BODIES OF WATER ON THE SURFACE. THE PLANET'S EXTREMELY STORMY.
3.56 - THERE REALLY IS LIQUID WATER HERE! TEMPERATURE WAS ABOUT 5
CELSIUS, AND I LANDED NEAR THE SHORELINE. LATS OF SMALL LAKES,
PLENTY OF PLANT LIFE WITH BRIGHT GREEN LEAVES, AND A HECK OF
BIRDS. ALL THIS SEEMS INVITING. WE'LL SEE...
7.36 - I'VE EXPECTED EVERYTHING FROZEN, BUT IT WAS WARMET THAN AT
THE EQUATOR! PLANT LIFE WAS QUITE SPARSE, BUT A LOT OF ANIMALS
WERE THERE. THE COLOURS OF EVERYTHING WERE DIFFERENT FROM
EQUATORIAL. OVERALL, THE SIGHT WAS NICE...
354.13 - YES, EVERYTHING'S BARREN AND FROZEN HERE, BUT THAT WAS
PREDICTABLE. WHAT'S STRANGE IS THAT I'VE SEEN AT LEAST FOUR
BIRDS THERE. THE SUDDEN JUMP OF TEMPERATURES (FROM +10 TO -126)
DIDN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE TO THEM...
6.75 - TWO ISLANDS HERE, AND AGAIN LOTS OF BIRDS. THEY'RE REALLY
COMMON HERE. I'M NOW OUT EXPLORING REST OF THIS SYSTEM, BUT I'LL
STATE THIS: SERPENTINE 7 IS AN EXCEPTIONAL PLANET WELL WORTH
VISITING. SERPENS, 6011 665.940

SOME HUGE STORMS. HAS ONE, NOTICEABLY SMALLER MOON.

I WISH MY GIRLFREIND WAS WITH ME, BUT SHE'S PROBABLY ON THE OTHER
SIDE OF THE GALAXY RIGHT NOW.
*SIGH* MAN I MISS HER.
MAN, I WISH THESE SHIPS COULD GO FASTER ON A FINE APPROACH.
THAT IS LIKE THE THRID TIME I WENT THROUGHT THE FRIGGEN SUN.
AH, LISTEN TO THE SOOTHING SOUNDS OF STATIC

WOW.
THAT DIRECT PARSIS JUMP IS A PRETTY NEAT THING.

(INHABITABLE PLANET DISCOVERED BY THE GREAT DEMENTO)
OOOOO...
NEVER EXPECTED TO FIND ONE OF THESE HERE.
THAT JUST GOES TO SHOW YOU THAT IT'S GOOD TO FIND A SYSTEM WITH A LOT
OF PLANTES AND MOONS.
I FOUND A NICE LARGE MOUNTAIN RANGE AT 145.22
I'VE SPOTTED A LARGE DARK SPOT ON THE PLANET. PROBABLY A CHASM. I'M
GOING TO GO DOWN AND CHECK IT OUT.
*SHAKES HIMSELF DRY* JUST MY LUCK.
THAT DARK SPOT TURNED OUT TO BE A LARGE SEA.
I HATE WATER.
I WISH MY RANDOM MUTATION WOULD PROVIDE SOMETHING THAT WOULD LET ME
HANDLE BETTER IN WATER.
GRR...STUPID FELISIAN GOVERNMENT EXPAIRIMENTS.
THEY DIDN'T THINK TO INCLUDE AQUATIC GENES IN THE MUTAGENE.
OH WELL.
BETTER GET BACK TO EXPLORING.
BY THE WAY, THAT SEA I LANDED IN IS AT 146.33, THOUGH YOU SHOULD BE
ABLE TO SPOT IT FROM THE STARDRIFTER
I FOUND ANOTHER MOUNTAINOUS AREA AT 67.90
THE AREA AROUND 0.60 IS STORMY AND HAS A LOT OF WHITE FOLIAGE.
I HAVE SPOTED A SHORE LINE, BUT UNFORTUNATELY, MY LINK WITH THE
SURFACE CAPSULE KEPT ME FROM INVESTIGATING FURTHER
I'VE DONE SOME CALCULATIONS AND I'M GOING TO RE-LAND TO TAKE ANOTHER
LOOK AT THAT AREA.
CRAP...
IT SEEMS MY CALCULATION WERE OFF.
I DID SPOT A GREY CANINE CREATURE, AND SEVERAL BLACK BIRDS.
MY CALCULATIONS GAVE ME THE COORDINATES 344.12.
THE AREA IS BARREN, BUT IT'S GOT SOME CREATURES.
BAH. ANOTHER BOTCHED TRY.
I DIDN'T FIND WHAT I WANTED A56.72.
AS A MATTER OF FACT, ALL I FOUND THERE WERE MOUNTAINS.
FORGET IT.
I'M JUST GONNA GET BACK TO NAMING THIS SYSTEM'S MOONS.
AND SO, I LEAVE THIS GORGEOUS PLACE.
IT'S MOUNTAINS AND VALLEY'S WILL STAY FRESH IN MY MEMORY FOR MANY
DAYS TO COME.
THANK YOU, AND HAPPY JOURNIES.(-DEMENTO)

SIGHTED A HOPPER (WHO LOST ME ON THE HILLY GROUND). GO FIGURE
SKINNYMON EPOC 6011 580.395
THE LIVELY APPEARANCE OF THIS PLANET WAS DECEPTIVE,
THE MAJORITY OF SECTORS THAT I LANDED IN HOLDING LITTLE IF NO
LIFE AT ALL. PLANT LIFE IS UNUSUALLY RARE,
AND I DIDN'T GET TO SPOT A HOPPER.
THE PLACE ECHOS SOMETHING DEPRESSIVE, AND...
I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE ANYMORE.

290:67. LANDED ON A SHORELINE. THE GROUND AROUND ME WAS VERY FLAT
BUT THERE WAS A LARGE HILL BEHIND ME, WHICH I SCALED. THE GRAVITY
WAS VERY AVERAGE, AT ABOUT .96 FELISIAN GRAVITY. THE PRESSURE
WAS RATHER HIGH, AROUND 1.4 ATM. I SAW BIRDS AND TREES AND BUSHES
BUT NO LAND ANIMALS. --EKA

THE MOON BARREN FLATS
WELL, IN SUMMARY, I'D SAY THAT AERION IS AN AVERAGE INHABITED PLANET.
NOTHING REALLY SPECIAL.
WELL, THAT'S ALL FOR ME HERE.FEEL FREE TO FURTHER EXPLORE THE PLANET.

TWO UTTERLY DULL MOONS.
LOOKS INTERESTING FROM ORBIT. IT ISN'T.
THE THIRD PLANET. A SURPRISINGLY BRIGHT THIN ATMO PLANET. STILL QUITE
DIM, HOWEVER, IT IS BRIGHT ENOUGH TO SEE. LAND FEATURES ARE AVERAGE.
SKY COLOR TENDS TO BE GREENISH, AND THE SURFACE YELLOWISH. COLOR AT
THE POLES ARE ALL AROUND PURPLE. ONE MOON.
(NOTES BY JEFF KEMP EPOC 6011:644:350)
THE FOURTH PLANET. A GREENISH QUARTZ WORLD. SOMEWHAT BRIGHT, BUT NOT
EXCESSIVELY. LAND FEATURES ARE AVERAGE, BLACK SPOTS ARE PRESENT.
SKY COLOR IS THE NORMAL BLUE, AND SURFACE COLOR RANGES FROM GREY,
GREEN, AND BLACK. ONE MOON.
(NOTES BY JEFF KEMP EPOC 6011:644:362)
THE FIFTH PLANET, A LONELY ROCKY PLANET. NOT MUCH OF NOTE, ALTHOUGH
THE SURFACE COLOR IS USUALLY VARIOUS SHADES OF TAN OR BROWN. LAND

THE ONLY MOON OF THE FOURTH PLANET, A GREEN DUSTY MOON. SURFACE COLOR IS
USUALLY ONLY SHADES OF GREEN, BUT LAND FEATURES MAY SOMETIMES BE
INTERESTING, CONSISTING USUALLY OF LARGE MOUNTAINS, VALLEYS, AND PERHAPS
EVEN CANYONS. NOT MUCH ELSE THOUGH.
(NOTES BY JEFF KEMP EPOC 6011:644:363)
THE FIRST MOON OF THE SEVENTH PLANET, A FELYSIAN WORLD. SURPRISINGLY,
IT DOES SUPPORT LIFE, EVEN THOUGH IT IS ALL AROUND QUITE COLD, WITH
TEMPERATURES JUST BARELY ABOVE THE FREEZING POINT. CONTINENTS ARE
QUITE WELL DEFINED. THE SKY TENDS TO BE A DEEP, DARK RED, ORANGE,
OR PURPLE COLOR, OR MIXES OF THEM. LAND COLOR IS USUALLY GREENISH,
BECAUSE OF THE GRASS, WHICH IS ACTUALLY QUITE BRIGHT IN CONTRAST
WITH THE SKY. RELATIVELY NORMAL, ALTHOUGH I HAVEN'T FOUND MUCH FOR
WILDLIFE. I'M PRETTY SURE THERE IS NATIVE WILDLIFE THOUGH. MOST OF
THE PLANET SEEMS TO BE COVERED WITH OCEAN.
SURPRISINGLY LOW GRAVITY AS WELL.

NAME FROM THE FACT THAT UPON DISCOVERY, I NOTICED A SINGLE, SMALL
CRATER ON THE SURFACE.
(NOTES BY JEFF KEMP EPOC 6011:644:367)
THE FOURTH MOON OF THE SEVENTH PLANET. A GREY ROCKY MOON. NOTHING OF
REAL NOTE HERE. THE SURFACE COLOR IS USUALLY JUST SHADES OF GREY, WITH
SLIGHT HINTS OF RED.
(NOTES BY JEFF KEMP EPOC 6011:644:381)

TOPPED HILLS, WITH OCCASIONAL VERY LOW HILLS HERE AND THERE. SURFACE
COLOR RANGES FROM LIGHT TO DARK BROWN.
(NOTES BY JEFF KEMP EPOC 6011:644:381)
THE SEVENTH MOON OF THE SEVENTH PLANET. A THICK ATMO PLANET.
SURPRISINGLY BRIGHT CONSIDERING HOW FAR IT IS FROM THE STAR. THE
SURFACE AREA CONSISTS OF VARIOUS SHADES OF A RATHER PRETTY PURPLE.
LAND FEATURES ARE NORMAL, WITH VOLCANOS, MOUNTAINS, MUTLI-RIDGED
CRATERS, AND SUCH. ALSO, IT SEEMS MONOTONE OR NEAR-MONOTONE LANDSCAPES
ARE QUITE COMMON.
(NOTES BY JEFF KEMP EPOC 6011:644:382)
THE EIGHTH MOON OF THE SEVENTH PLANET, A DUSTY MOON. NOT MUCH OF NOTE.
FAIRLY SMOOTH AS SEEN FROM SPACE. SURFACE COLOR IS USUALLY A VARIETY
OF GREYS.
(NOTES BY JEFF KEMP EPOC 6011:644:429)
THE NINTH MOON OF THE SEVENTH PLANET, A YELLOW, DARK QUARTZ WORLD.
LAND FEATURES ARE AVERAGE, AND THE SKY IS ACTUALLY NOT BRIGHT AT ALL.
LAND COLORATION VARIES FROM TAN TO ORANGE. NOT MUCH ELSE OF NOTE HERE.
(NOTES BY JEFF KEMP EPOC 6011:645:387)
THE TENTH MOON OF THE SEVENTH PLANET, A PRETTY BLUE QUARTZ WORLD.
NOT MUCH IN THE WAY OF LAND FEATURES, BUT THE SURFACE IS VERY DIM,
AND THE COLOR RANGES FROM PURPLE, PALE BLUE, TO REGULAR BLUE. QUITE
PRETTY.
(NOTES BY JEFF KEMP EPOC 6011:645:388)
THE ELEVENTH MOON OF THE SEVENTH PLANET, A VERY COLD FELYSIAN PLANET.
VERY FEW TEMPERATE REGIONS WITH PLANT LIFE, AND THEY USUALLY TEND TO
BE FAR APART. ALSO, THERE ARE VERY FEW TO NO LARGE BODIES OF WATER,
MOST OF IT IS ICE. PLANT LIFE USUALLY TENDS TO HAVE BRIGHT, SEEMINGLY
GLOWING, LEAVES. NOT TOO MUCH IN THE WAY OF ANIMAL LIFE, ALTHOUGH BIRDS
ARE COMMON. USUALLY THE COLD REGIONS HAVE A BLUE SURFACE, WITH A
YELLOWISH SKY, SOMETIMES QUITE PRETTY.
(NOTES BY JEFF KEMP EPOC 6011:645:389)
THE TWELFTH MOON OF THE SEVENTH PLANET, A VERY RARE THICK ATMO WORLD.
THE SURFACE IS ACTUALLY CLEAR, A RARE FIND! THE SURFACE COLOR IS USUALLY

THIS PLANET IS SO BIG THAT IT IS BOUND TO HAVE A MAJOR EFFECT ON THE
ORBITS OF THE OTHER PLANETS. HOSTILE THUNDERSTORMS SPOTTED FROM ORBIT.
(STARGAZER. EPOC 6011:604:949)
THIS PLANET COULD HAVE LIFEFORMS ON IT, HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE
GAS-GIANT WHICH ORBITS CLOSER TO THE SUN. THE GAS-GIANT HAS BENDED THE
ORBIT OF THIS PLANET TO EXTREME DEGREES, AND SUSTAINING LIFE FOR A
LONGER AMOUNT OF TIME IS DOWNSTRAIGHT IMPOSSIBLE.

THIS CLOUDY MOON HAS SEVERAL GIGANTIC CANYONS, CHASIMS AND PITS -
POSSIBLY MADE BY COMETS OR METEORITES, OR MAYBE VOLCANIC ACTIVITY
IN THIS MOONS DISTANT PAST. BEING SO CLUMSY, I HAPPENED TO FALL INTO
THOSE QUITE OFTEN. AND ON THE GROUND OF THESE CHASMS, I FOUND
SEVERAL TRANSPERENT HILLS AND OTHER OBJECTS - POSSIBLY ICE, TOUGH

IT WAS 50 DEGREES CELCIUS. THE PULSAR COULD BE SEEN OVERHEAD,
AND IT WAS RATHER FUNKY-LOOKING. THE ATMOSPHERE MADE IT SPIKE
SPIKEY, THAT IS, AND YOU COULD SEE THE RADIATION BOUNCING ALL
OVER THE PLACE IN THE GLARE. STILL THOUGH, NOT VERY
INTERESTING IN THE RIDICULOUSLY DARK PLANET. NEXT TIME I FIND

ENCOUNTERED. --EKA
THIS CRATERED PLANET ON EKA56 HAS A VERY FAR-REACHING AND NOTICABLE
RING, THOUGH IT ISN'T PARTICULARLY THICK OR LAYERED. OLIVE-GREEN
IN COLOR. NOT A BAD PLANET, ONE OF THE MORE INTERESING CRATERED ONES
I'VE ENCOUNTERED. --EKA
A SIDE NOTE, ITS AXIS IS SLIGHTLY TILTED, AS CAN BE SEEN BY THE
RING. --EKA
THIS GAS GIANT ON EKA56 IS EXCELLENT. ITS COLOR RANGES FROM BLACK
TO WHITE, GOING THROUGH SHADES OF GREENISH YELLOW. QUITE A
WONDEROUS GAS GIANT, AND IT HAS AROUND 17 MOONS TO BOOT! --EKA
I MISCOUNTED THE NUMBER OF MOONS HERE, IT'S MORE LIKE 14 OR SO.
SOME OF THEM ARE QUITE NICE, THOUGH. EXCELLENT PLANET. --EKA
THIS GREEN CRATERED PLANET ON EKA56 WAS NAMED NOT FOR ITS
COLOR BUT FOR ITS TEXTURE. IT HAS A FAR-OUT BUT FAIRLY THICK
RING. THE AXIS IS FAIRLY TILTED, AS IS EVIDENT FROM THE RING.
GOOD-LOOKING; THE COLOR IS NICE. --EKA
VERY INTERESTING FELISIAN PLANET ON EKA56, AND I HAVEN'T EVEN LANDED
ON IT YET. IT HAS A WHOPPING 3 MOONS, WHICH IN MY EXPERIENCE IS A LOT
FOR A FELISIAN PLANET. IT ALSO HAS A VERY FAINT BUT TELLING RING THAT
SHOWS OFF ITS FAIRLY TILTED ORBIT. I'M GOING TO GO EXPLORE NOW. --EKA
LANDED ON 345:31 ON A MULCHY OR GRAINY SURFACE. NO WATER OR LIFE
EVIDENT. HILLY. GOING TO GO INTO THE ARC OF A STORM NOW. --EKA
LANDED ON 335:46 IN A FAIRLY IDENTICAL AREA, JUST CLOUDY THIS TIME.
GOING TO TAKE MY CHANCES AND LAND IN THE MIDDLE OF A LARGE STORM.
--EKA
255:32. CENTER OF A STORM; NOTHING BUT SOME LIGHTNING. THIS SEEMS TO
BE A DESERT PLANET. I'M TRYING ONE MORE PLACE BEFORE GIVING UP. --EKA
287:80. HEHEHEHE. LANDED IN THE MIDDLE OF A RAGING OCEAN AND WAS
SWEPT BACK INTO MY CRAFT A LITTLE BIT AFTER GETTING OUT. FUN STUFF.
ANYWAY, I HAVE A HUNCH ABOUT THIS.. THAT I KNOW WHERE TO LAND FOR
NEXT TIME. --EKA
282:82. ALMOST, BUT NOT QUITE. ANOTHER DRY AREA. I'M GOING BACK IN.
289:81! I DID IT!! EUREKA! I FOUND THE SHORELINE AND THERE WAS LIFE!!
THERE WAS GRASS, THERE WAS A FOREST ON AN ENORMOUS HILL, THERE WAS A
BIRD FLYING AROUND! IT WAS WONDERFUL. MY WORK HERE IS DONE. NOW I
JUST NEED TO FINISH UP THE SYSTEM AND I CAN REST EASY. --EKA
OOPS, SORRY, THE RING SHOWS OFF ITS TILTED AXIS.. NOT ORBIT. --EKA
I WAS WONDERING WHAT THIS PLANET REMINDED ME OF, AND I FINALLY
REALIZED THAT IT LOOKED LIKE A GLOBE OF GREEN LIQUID METAL. IT'S
A CLOUD-COVERED MOON OF SANITY FLUX ON EKA56. IT LOOKS QUITE NICE
AND THE PLANET IT ORBITS IS VERY BEAUTIFUL. --EKA
CLOUD-COVERED MOON OF SANITY WARP ON EKA56. HAS VARYING SHADES OF BROWN
AND PRETTY MUCH THE EXACT COLOR OF COFFEE WITH MILK. IT LOOKS VERY NICE
AND IS WORTH A VISIT. --EKA
WHEN NAMING THIS PLANET, BOTH BLUE MARBLE AND TO MY VAST
SURPRISE, SAPPHIRE MARBLE WERE TAKEN FOR NAMES. ANYWAY, THIS IS
A CLOUD-COVERED MOON OF SANITY WARP ON EKA56 AND HAS A
BEAUTIFUL COLOR AND TEXTURE. WORTH A VISIT, PARTICULARLY AS
THERE ARE OTHER GREAT SITES TO SEE ON THIS SYSTEM. --EKA
THIN ATMOSPHERE MOON OF SANITY WARP ON EKA56. DUSTY TEXTURE
AND COLOR. GREENISH WITH BLACK SPOTS. --EKA
CRATERED MOON OF SANITY WARP ON EKA56. VERY SMALL, SHINY CRATERS
ON THE WHITE SURFACE MAKE IT SEEM AS IF THIS MOON IS BOILING.
--EKA
THIN-ATMOSPHERE MOON OF SANITY WARP ON EKA56. UNLIKE THE OTHER
MOON 'SKELETON OF DUST' HERE, THIS ONE SEEMS TO STILL BE
ROTTING RATHER THAN DECAYED FULLY. THEY ARE VERY SIMILAR. --EKA
QUARTZ MOON OF SANITY WARP ON EKA56. NICE COLOR, NICE TEXTURE.
ONE OF THE BETTER QUARTZ BODIES I'VE SEEN. --EKA
QUARTZ MOON OF SANITY WARP ON EKA56. VERY NICE COLOR; I HAVEN'T
SEEN A QUARTZ MOON QUITE LIKE THIS ONE BEFORE. --EKA
CRATERED MOON OF SANITY WARP ON EKA56. THE CRATERS ARE WHITE WHILE
THE MOON ITSELF IS MORE OF A LIGHT GREEN. HENCE THE NAME. --EKA
PLAIN GREY CLOUD-COVERED MOON OF SANITY WARP ON EKA56. GREENISH
'BELT' AREA AROUND THE EQUATOR. --EKA
THE FLUFFY PINK COLOR AND TEXTURE OF THIS CLOUD-COVERED PLANET
INSPIRED THE NAME. ORBITS EKA56 (RIGHT, IT'S A MOON NOT A
PLANET).. ORBITS SANITY WARP ON THE STAR EKA56. SORRY ABOUT
THAT, IT'S GETTING A BIT LATE. --EKA
CRATERED MOON OF SANITY WARP ON EKA56. NAMED IN HONOR OF THE CHARACTER
SNOWDEN IN CATCH-22 (THE BOOK). THE REASON IS THAT THIS MOON LOOKS
VERY BADLY WOUNDED, AS SNOWDEN WAS. THE CRATERS HERE ARE IMMENSE AND
DARK. --EKA
CRATERED MOON OF SANITY WARP ON EKA56. --EKA
A VERY BEAUTIFUL INTERNALLY HOT MOON OF SANITY WARP ON EKA56.
GOLDEN COLOR, SHINING. WORTH A VISIT, THIS IS PROBABLY THE
BEST INTERNALLY HOT MOON/PLANET I'VE YET SEEN! --EKA
CRATERED MOON OF SANITY WARP ON EKA56. NICE GREY COLOR. NOT A BAD
ONE. --EKA
FELISIAN MOON OF SANITY WARP ON EKA56. INTERESTING BLUE COLOR, THE
STORMS HERE ARE INCREDIBLY BRIGHT. THE PLANET REALLY SEEMS INSANE OR
WARPED SOMEHOW. I'M GOING TO GO ONTO IT, THOUGH I FEAR THAT IT WILL
BE STORMY AND WATERY. --EKA
LANDED ON 116:25, IN A PATCH OF ONE OF THE SMALL CLOUDLESS AREAS. I
FOUND A WHITE, WATERLESS SURFACE WITH A GRAINY GROUND. NO LIFE WAS
APPARENT, BUT THE AREA WAS VERY HILLY. I'M GOING TO GO ONTO AN ARC
OF ONE OF THE STORM CLOUDS NOW. --EKA
LANDED ON 175:45. FOUND MYSELF SWEPT AWAY FROM MY CRAFT BY WINDS. THE
AREA WAS ALL WATER. I THINK I MIGHT HAVE SEEN A BIRD ON DESCENT BUT
PERHAPS NOT. I NEED TO FIND AN AREA WITH BOTH WATER AND LAND... --EKA
LANDED ON 90:83 ON AN EXPANSE OF BEAUTIFUL GREEN-PURPLE WATER;
UNFORTUNATELY, IT WAS VERY WINDY. STILL NO SIGN OF LIFE, NOR COULD I
SPOT ANY LAND. --EKA
LANDED ON 102:44 AND FOUND MYSELF IN ANOTHER GRAINY, HILLY, WATERLESS
AND LIFELESS AREA. SURELY THERE MUST BE A PLACE WITH BOTH WATER AND
LAND? I'M GOING IN AGAIN. --EKA
LANDED ON 76:89. STILL NO LUCK. ANOTHER GRAINY AREA. I'M GIVING UP ON
THIS MOON; IT SEEMS TO BE MAINLY COMPOSED OF RAGING OCEANS AND BLAND
HILLS, AN UNLIKELY BUT ANNOYING COMBINATION. --EKA
BWAHAHAHAH, I THINK I'VE FOUND THE ANSWER! HERE I GO.. --EKA
141:21!! I'VE DONE IT! MY THEORY HAS PROVEN CORRECT AND I SHOULD NOW
BE ABLE TO FIND LIFE ON VIRTUALLY ANY FELISIAN WORLD! NOW THEN, THIS
IS ALL WELL AND GOOD:THERE WAS GRASS AND SHRUBS AND BIRDS AND LAND
ANIMALS, BUT THE MOST INTERESTING PART WAS THE 'GHOST TREES'. THAT'S
RIGHT, GHOST TREES. THE TREES IN THE AREA I VISITED ARE TRANSPARENT!
THE TRUNKS ARE, ANYWAY. THEY ARE VISIBLE BUT SEE-THROUGH!! IT IS AN
AMAZING PHENOMENON. DEFINITELY WORTH A VISIT, NO MATTER HOW BUSY YOU
ARE WITH OTHER MATTERS OF THIS WORLD. IT'S FUNKY STUFF. WELL, THAT'S
PLANET DEMENTED FOR YOU, I SUPPOSE. IT TRULY LIVED UP TO ITS NAME.
THERE YOU HAVE IT. NOW GO OUT THERE AND SEE THE TREES FOR YOURSELF!
--EKA
THIN-ATMOSPHERE MOON OF STUDDED LEATHER ON EKA56. DARK. SEEMS

MOON, WORTH A VISIT, ESPECIALLY SINCE THE SYSTEM HAS OTHER INTERESTING
ASPECTS. --EKA

ARE SPREAD OUT ALL OVER RATHER THAN MAINLY AT THE EQUATOR. THREE

LANDED ON 86:47 IN THE MIDDLE OF A LAKE. IT WASN'T BAD THOUGH,
IT'S NICE TO SEE BLUE WATER FOR A CHANGE :). --EKA
96:79 ON A SHORELINE. VAST, SHORT HILLS, BROWNISH GREEN GRASS AND
SHRUBS, ABOUT 10 CELCIUS, BIRDS FLYING ABOUT, SAW A HOPPING
LAND CREATURE. NICE BLUE-AND-BROWN TREES, THOUGH IT WAS ONLY
SPARSELY WOODED. IT'S A CALM AREA. --EKA
87:37. -20 CELCIUS. FROZEN HILLS, VERY WIDE AND SHORT. BEAUTIFUL
GREEN SKY AND BLUE HILLS. I CAME ACROSS A TINY POND NORTH BY
NORTHWEST OF MY LANDING SITE. IT WAS FROZEN AND ABSOLUTELY
STUNNING. THERE WERE MANY GREEN HOPPERS HERE. THIS IS A VERY NICE
PLANET, ONE OF THE BEST FELISIAN ONES I'VE VISITED. I'M GOING TO
EXPLORE IT MORE A LITTLE LATER. --EKA

A BEAUTIFUL FELISIAN PLANET IN A 503 SYSTEM!
THIS PLANET HAS RUINS THAT SEEM TO GLOW IN THE SUBDUED LIGHT THAT
FILTERS THROUGH THE THICK CLOUDS. MY POD'S LANDING BEAM WAS HARD TO
SEE, PROBABLY BECAUSE OF THE 28 ATM PRESSURE DOWN THERE.

MORE BLACK BIRDS THOUGH.
BY THE WAY, MY ORIGIONAL LANDING POINT IS 0.60

THIS IS A REMOTE WORLD IN A PULSAR SYSTEM, AND LANDING ON IT WILL
CAST YOU INTO AN ALMOST-IMPENETRABLE DARKNESS, MADE EVEN DARKER
BY THE THIN, BUT INSISTENTLY PRESENT ATMOSPHERE.
-PARRY LOST, 6011.712.946
THIS MOON OF THE FIFTH PLANET IN THE BLUEFIRE SYSTEM IS
CRISS-CROSSED WITH REMARCABLY CLEAR AND REGULAR BLACK LINES,
WHICH MAKE ONE IMMEDIATELY THINK OF ROADS, OR PERHAPS CANALS.
TEMPTING THOUGH THIS EXPLANATION IS, THEY ARE LIKELY A NATURAL
PHENOMENON, SINCE IT IS DOUBTFUL ANY LIFE COULD SURVIVE ON THIS
AIRLESS, FROZEN, RADIATION-BATHED WORLD.

A VERY PRETTY PLANET, IF I DO SAY SO MYSELF.
FURTHER NOTES:LANDED AT 248.55, BUT IT WAS UNDER A WEATHER FRONT AT

THIS IS TURNING OUT TO BE AN AMAZING PLACE.
GO TO 20.54 NOW!!
THIS IS CALLED THE 'CARDINAL VALLEY FOREST'
LOOK TO THE EAST AND WEST. THOS ARE THE 'CARDINAL HILLS'
PROCEED TO 20.54:5.-16
THIS IS A HUGE TREE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FOREST.
ONE OF THE BIGGEST I'VE EVER SEEN.
AROUND THE HILLS, THERE ARE ABSOLUTLE
AMAZING CLIFF COMPLEXES. THESE ARE FUN TO PLAY AROUND WITH
DON'T MISS THIS PLANET UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES!
I HAVE DONE A MORE FULL INVESTIGATION OF THE CARDINAL VALLEY AREA.
THE CLIFF SECTION TO THE EAST SMALL LAKE/PONDS AT THE BOTTOM.
THESE ARE QUITE INTERESTING TO SEE.
I HAVE LOCATED ANOTHER LARGE TREE. 'DEATH TREE' AT14,-32.
I AM MAKING A TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP OF THIS AREA, SINCE IT HAS SO MUCH
TO SEE.
AT 329.69 IS 'SPYDER ISLE'
THE SHIP LANDS ON A NICE HILLSIDE OVERLOOKING THE OCEAN.
LOTS OF PLANTLIFE IN THIS AREA, AND ALSO LOTS OF ANIMALS.
AT 17.6 IS THE SECTION OF THE NORTH POLE CALLED 'EIS'
NOT MUCH TO SEE HERE, BYT THE HILLS ARE TALLER THAN THEY LOOK...
WHICH STILL ISN'T REALLY VERY TALL.
(NOTES BY EXPLORER)
FURTHER NOTES:I HEARD A REPORT OF THE TREE OF THARIUS, AND UPON
CHECKING DISCOVERED I WAS NEARBY. WHEN I GOT HERE, THE SITE WAS ON
THE DARK SIDE OF THE WORLD- KIND OF LIKE REACHING AN AMUSEMENT PARK
AND FINDING IT CLOSED. SO, I DECIDED TO MAKE EXCURSIONS TO THE OTHER
FELISIAN WORLDS IN THIS SYSTEM (SEE MY NOTES THERE) AND LATER CAME
BACK. I SAW THE TREE-YES, IT'S A TREE, YES, IT'S BIG. AND I VENTURED
FORTH TOWARD THE CLIFFS TO THE EAST. WHEN I REACHED 20.54:-18.23, I
REALIZED I WAS FACING A SIMILAR CHANGE IN HORIZON AS WHEN I FELL INTO
A RESERVOIR IN THE FENIA SYSTEM. DON'T WANT TO DO THAT AGAIN! UPON
FURTHER REVIEW THERE ARE SUPPPOSED TO BE LAKES DOWN THERE. I HATE
WATER, AND I HATE CLIMBING OUT OF HOLES. SO I DECLINED THE INVITATION.
THOSE WHO WISH TO DO SO, GO. BUT BE FOREWARNED.

ANYWAY, A FIRST LANDING PAINTED A RATHER PRETTY SCENE; AT 7,70
THERE ARE ROLLING HILLS WITH REALLY HEALTHY GREENISH GRASS AND
ALMOST CRYSTALLINE PURPLE SHRUBS. THE VIEW WAS MADE PRETTIER BY THE
SUN HANGING LOW JUST ABOVE HILLS TO THE SOUTHWEST AND A LARGE
LONG-EARED HOPPER(OKAY, THE HOPPER CAN BE LEFT OUT).
14,59 ALSO HAS SIMILAR LUSH FLORA. THERE IS A RATHER FASCINATING
CANYON IN THE SECTOR, WHICH ACTUALLY 'LEADS' TO LOWER LAND. ANOTHER
INTERESTING FEATURE CAN BE FOUND AT ABOUT THE -38,13 VICINITY.
I...DARESAY IT APPEARS LIKE A PROTO-PYRAMID, OR LIKE A RATHER
SMOOTH FELISIAN VERSION OF ONE OF THOSE MULTIFACETED BOULDER-STYLE
OBJECTS USUALLY FOUND ON QUARTZ WORLDS.
FURTHER LANDINGS HAVE REVEALED MORE ROLLING MEADOWS, LIKE THOSE AT
120, 30 IS AN INTERESTING SPOT. VEGETATON HERE SEEMS...OF THE MORE
HARDY VARIETY. NOT AS LUSH OR BRIGHT, BUT THEN AGAIN IT COULD BE
JUST THE HARSH SUNLIGHT OF THE AREA. THE TOPOGRAPHY IS ALSO WORTH
A RUNABOUT.
AT THE EQUATORIAL REGIONS PLENTY OF HEALTHY LUSH MEADOWS CAN BE
FOUND(MADE A TYPO UP THERE...THE SPOT I MENTIONED ABOVE WAS NOT
THE MEADOW I WAS REFERRING TO). VEGATATION ON THIS PLANET SEEMS TO
TAKE 3 FORMS. THE LUSH GREEN TYPE AT THE 'TROPICS', THE ORANGEY

BARREN WORLD. PATCHES OF POSSIBLY ICE OR SNOW ON THE SURFACE.
CONFIRMED, LANDING WAS ON DAY SIDE. PLANET IS INHERENTLY DARK DUE TO
CLOUD COVER.
(ALSO DISCOVERED BY THE GREAT DEMENTO)
THIS FIRST PLANET IN THE NOIRO SYSTEM, APPEARS TO BE A SMALL PLANETOID
WITH OXYGEN ATMOSPHERE, SURFACE MAINLY COMPOSED OF QUARTS, AND IT GOT
SOME NICE RINGS.
(STARGAZER. EPOC 6011:609:594)
THIS PLANET APPEARS TO BE A JUPITER-SIZED GAS-GIANT, ORBITING IN A
REALTIVELY CLOSE DISTANCE TO ITS STAR.
HUGE AND VOILENT STORMS IN ITS UPPER ATMOSPHERE WAS SPOTTED FROM ORBIT
, THE SHIPS INSTRUMENTS ALSO FIND LARGE TRASES OF CARBON AND OXYGEN -
SUGGESTING THAT LIFE MAY BE EXISTING FLOATING HIGH UP IN THE
ATMOSPHERE OF THIS SUPERPLANET.
(STARGAZER. EPOC 6011:609:594)
THIS LOVELY LITTLE PLANETOID IS A FELISIAN ONE - SUPPORTING LIFE.
THIS PLANET IS ALSO A WARM-HONE, EVEN AT THE NORTH POLE AT NIGHT, THIS
PLANET HAS TEMPERATURES AT 22 DEGREES CENTIGRADE.
THIS, OFF COURSE, GIVES COURSE FOR SEVERAL LARGE STORMS WHICH IS
ALMOST EVERYWHERE ON THIS PLANET - WHEREVER YOU LAND, YOU WILL ALMOST
ALWAYS FIND YOURSELF LANDING IN A STORM OR ON ONE OF THE GIGANTIC
OCEANS.
BUT THIS PLANET ALSO HAS A LOT OF FORRESTS AND ANIMAL LIFE.
(STARGAZER. EPOC 6011:609:596)
THIS PLANET HAS A SURFACE OF MAINLY QUARTS, AND A ATMOSPHERE OF OXYGEN

SMALL, SOLID, FULLY COVERED BY CLOUDS AND A THICK ATMOSPHERE.
VERY DARK SURFACE MAKES EXPLORATION VERY HARD, OFTEN RISKY.
LANDING IS NOT ADVICED.
(STARGAZER. EPOC 6011:609:597)
DUE TO TIDAL STRESS FROM THE NEARBY GAS-GIANT, AND DUE TO THE OTHER
MOON OF NOIRO 3, THIS MOON, THE FIRST MOON OF NOIRO 3, HAS A VERY
UNSTABLE SURFACE - VERY MUCH LIKE THAT OF JUPITERS IO.
LANDING IS THEREFORE IMPOSSIBLE.
(STARGAZER. EPOC 6011:609:596)
THIS IS VERY MUCH A NORMAL MOON - DUSTY, CRATERIZED, AND

NAMED TO SOUND LIKE 'CARTOGRAPHY', BECAUSE OF THE COMPLETE DARKNESS OF
THE WORLD (AT LEAST, IT WAS FOR ME) IT IS PERFECT FOR STARGAZING, BUT
MAKE SURE YOU USE YOUR RADIATION VISOR SO YOU CAN SEE WHERE YOU ARE
GOING.
MY APOLOGIES. I RECENTLY DISCOVERED THAT IT IS POSSIBILE TO
INTENTIONALLY LAND ON THE DAY-SIDE OF A PLANET. THIS PLANET WAS NAMED
FOR ITS NIGHT-SIDE STARGAZING APPEAL. AGAIN, MY APOLOGIES.
AN EMPTY PLANET, WITH 1.038 FGS OF GRAVITY. THE PLANETS I'VE SEEN IN
S10 SYSTEMS ARE ALL HEAVY... EVEN THE NO ATMOSPHERE ONES. I DON'T SEE
HOW THEY DON'T HAVE AN ATMOSPHERE EXCEPT MAYBE THAT THE S10 STAR PULLED
THE PLANETS FAST ENOUGH TO RID THEM OF THEIR ATMOSPHERES. UNINTERESTING
IN ITSELF, EXCEPT THE FACT THAT IT EXISTS.

THIS OBJECT IS THE COMPANION OF VITRINYA, THERE IS NO PARTICULAR
THING TO SAY ABOUT IT, ONLY THE INCREDIBLE ABUNDANCE OF THE QUARTZITE

THE PARTICULARITY OF THIS OBJECT IS THE TRANSPARENCY OF ITS MOUNTAINS
THESE SEEMS TO BE COMPOSED BY QUARTZITE OF EXEPTIONAL PURETY, THIS
TYPE OF PURETY CAN ONLY BE OBTAINED UNDER HIGH PRESSURE CONDITIONS SO
MY HYPOTHESIS IS THAT BODY WAS CAPTURED BY THE GRAVITY OF AN ANCIENT
GIANT STAR WHO GOES IN RUNAWAY STATE AND LEFT BEHIND HER THIS LITTLE

THICK ATMOSPHERE PLANET. IT'S LANDSCAPE IS VERY INTERESTING, BEING
MADE OF MOUNTAINS, DEEP CLIFFS AND PLATEUS. APART FROM THAT, THERE'S
NOT MUCH TO SEE.
DISCOVERED BY CAPT. CARLOS ON 6011.603.402.474. PLAEY'S PEARL IS

NO DESCRIPTION CAN DO JUSTICE TO THIS GLORIOUS WORLD. ENDLESS ROLLING
HILLS, MOUNTAINS. IT MUST BE VISITED.
DISCOVERED TWO PHENOMENA ON SERENIA: THE SPIRES AND THE GULF.
THE SPIRES ARE A SET OF NEAR-VERTICAL PIKES IN THE GROUND, UNCLIMBABLE
THE GULF IS A DARK AREA OF SERENIA, APPEARING AS A BLACK SQUARE SPOT
ON THE LANDING SCANNER. I AM WRITING THIS BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO MAP
THESE LOCATIONS. SINCE I COULD NOT FIND THE GULF BY LANDING NEXT TO
IT AND WALKING, I CONCLUDE THAT IT MAY BE WITHIN THE SPIRES, OR
PERHAPS THE GROUND IS FARTHER SPREAD ON THE SURFACE THAN ON THE
SCANNER. EPOC 6011 - 793.542.507 AT TIME OF WRITING.

LOGS OF PLANET DISCOVERY FOLLOWS:
INITIAL SCANS OF THE PLANET SHOW THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF LIFE.
I BEGIN TO EXPLORE THE PLANET.
MY FIRST LANDING REVEALS THAT MY HOPES HAVE BEEN WELL FOUNDED.
THERE IS LIFE ON THIS PLANET. PLANT AND ANIMAL. LAND AND FLYING.
THE PLANET'S NAME DERIVES FROM A CREATURE I FOUND ON THE PLANET.
IT APPEARED TO BE A GIANT FERRET-LIKE ORGANISM.
OTHER LIFEFORMS NOTED INCLUDED A FLYING CREATURE AND A BIPEDAL HOPPING
ONE.
PLANT LIFE IS ABUNDANT. IT RANGES FROM GRASS TO BUSHES AND TREES.
I HAD, UNFORTUNATELY,RETURNED TO MY SHIP BEFORE REMEMBERING TO TAKE
PHOTOS
AFTER RETURNING FROM A REFUELING STOP AT A NEARBY STAR, I LANDED AGAIN.
I DISCOVERED A LARGE HILL ON THE HORIZON, AND WALKED TOWARDS IT.
TURNING, I SAW TO LARGE BROWNISH SPLOTCHES FROM WHENCE I CAME.
THE WEATHER ON THIS TRIP HAD TAKEN A TURN FOR THE WORSE.
THERE WAS LIGHTNING AND THUNDER, INDICATING DYNAMIC WEATHER PATTERNS.
MY VISION THUS OBSCURED, I STUMBLED ONTO ONE OF THE SPLOTCHES.
IT WAS ACTUALLY A GIGANTIC HOLE OR CRATER OF SOME SORT.
AT THE BOTTOM WAS A PUDDLE, THE FIRST STANDING WATER I HAD SEEN HERE.
AFTER TAKING SOME PHOTOS OF THE AREA, I RETURNED TO MY SHIP.
(PHOTOS AQUIRED FOR THIS TRIP)
I RETURNED TO THE PLANET ONCE MORE.
THE NEW AREA WAS GRASSY AND HILLY.
I SAW MORE FLYERS, BUT THE PLAINS SEEMED DEVOID OF OTHER LIFE.
I DID SPOT SOME SORT OF QUADRAPEDAL FELINE.
UNFORTUNATELY, IT WAS QUICK, AND ESCAPED BEFORE I COULD READY MY CAMERA.
AFTER SEARCHING THE SURFACE FOR A GOOD WHILE, I RETURNED TO MY SHIP.
(PHOTOS AQUIRED)
I RETURNED TO THE PLANET, TO FIND A HUGE SPIRE IN THE DISTANCE.
HOWEVER, MY LANDING CRAFT MALFUNCTIONED AND RETURNED TO THE SHIP.
I WAS UNABLE TO AQUIRE ANY PHOTOS.
I RETURNED TO THE PLANT AGAIN. I HAVE SEEN NO MORE GROUND LIFE.
SINCE THE FIRST VISIT, ONLY THE FLIERS HAVE BEEN AROUND.
I HAVE RETURNED TO THE HOLE SECTION TO DO SOME MORE EXPLORING.
THE SURROUNDING AREA, BEHIND THE HILL, REVEALED A LARGE BODY OF WATER.
I ASSUME IT IS AN OCEAN OR GIANT LAKE.
I EXPLORED THE SECOND OF THE TWO HOLES, AS WELL.
I CANNOT HELP BUT WONDER WHAT HAS CAUSED THEM.
I ALSO WONDER WHAT HAPPENED TO THE VARIOUS LIFEFORMS FROM TRIP ONE.
I RETURNED TO THE SHIP, SATISFIED WITH FINDING THE LAKE/OCEAN.

THIS MOON IS EXTREMELY DIM GIVEN THAT MOST BODIES OF NATIVE QUARTZ
HAVE A VERY BRIGHT SKY. (NOTES BY JILANTY EPOC6011 569.100)
BY SOME FORM OF MIRACLE, THERE EXISTS LIFE ON THIS DISTANT MOON -- BOTH
PLANT AND ANIMAL LIFE. I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT THIS MOON WAS FAR TOO
COLD AND WAY TOO DARK. I FOUND A LAND ANIMAL, A FELISIAN CAT-LIKE
CREATURE IN AN AREA WHERE THE SURFACE TEMPERATURE WAS -117C! PLANT LIFE
HERE SEEMS TO BE RESTRICTED TO THE EQUATOR, WHERE THE TEMPERATURE JUST
BARELY MAKES IT UP TO 15C. (NOTES BY JILANTY EPOC6011 569.103)
THE SOUTHERN POLE OF THIS PLANET IS A LARGE FOREST AND THE TEMP IS +6.5C
THE ONLY ANIMAL LIFE I OBSERVED WAS IN THE AIR.
NOTES BY (MARK SHUTTLEWORTH EPOC 6011:569:527)
LIKE ITS NEIGHBOURING MOON, HYPROXIA AMAZINGLY SUPPORTS LIFE. BUT
PLANT LIFE HERE IS VERY MINIMAL AND DIFFICULT TO FIND, AS IS ANIMAL
LIFE. AT COORDS 000:060 THE TRUNKS OF THE TREES ARE TRANSPARENT!
CANT FIND ANY PART OF THE SURFACE OF THIS MOON WITH A TEMPERATURE
ABOVE 10C. (NOTES BY JILANTY EPOC6011 569.104)

INCONSISTENCY IN ITS LIGHT, SOME AREAS BEING VERY DARK AND OTHER
AREAS BEING VERY BRIGHT. (NOTES BY JILANTY EPOC6011 568.939)
COULDN'T FIND ANY LAND ANIMALS HERE, ONLY BIRDS AND PLANT LIFE.
THERE IS A HUGE ICEBERG AT COORDS 345.105 IT HAS A BEAUTIFUL
BLUE COLOUR. (NOTES BY JILANTY EPOC6011 568.940)
THIS QUARTZ MOON HAS A VERY BRIGHT SKY. BE CAREFUL IF YOU LAND
ON A HIGH HILL, BECAUSE THE SKY IS SO BRIGHT YOU WONT BE ABLE
TO SEE YOUR LIGHT BEAM IN THE WHITE SKY.

THIS PLANET WAS DISCOVERED BY THRONUS DALVI, EPOC 6011:660.31.162.
THIS PLANET MAY LOOK NICE ON THE OUTSIDE, BUT DON'T LAND ON IT.
THE PLANET IS COMPLETELY COVERED IN CLOUDS, GIVING IT A GASEOUS
LOOK. UPON LANDING, THE TEMPERATURE SHOT UP TO OVER 94 DEGREES C,
AND THE ATMOSPHERE OSCILLATED BETWEEN 35.122 TO 34.9 ATM. THE
GRAVITY WAS ONLY .712 FG, AND THE VISION IS HORRIBLE, AS EVERYTHING
IS GIVEN A BLURRY BLACK AND WHITE. DON'T LAND. EVER.
(NOTES BY THRONUS DALVI, EPOC 6011:660.31.304)
THIS PLANET WAS DISCOVERED BY THRONUS DALVI IN EPOC 6011:659.945.53.
THIS PLANET HAS A THIN ATMOSPHERE OF .045 ATM, AND LOW GRAVITY OF .705FG
A FULL ROTATION IS ONLY 92:880, AND A FULL REVOLUTION IS 26.196.800.
THE PLANET IS VERY MOUNTAINOUS, WITH BLUE MINERALS STICKING OUT OF THE
MOUNTAIN SIDES. MANY ROCK FORMATIONS EXIST ON ITS SURFACE.
(NOTES BY THRONUS DALVI, EPOC 6011:659.945.460)
THIS PLANET WAS DISCOVERED BY THRONUS DALVI IN EPOC 6011:659.855.860.
THE PLANET HAS A PRESSURE RATING BETWEEN .76 TO .79. THE TEMPERATURE
IS HOT, THE CELSIUS DEGREES REACHING 39.2 ON AVERAGE.
THE GRAVITY IS 1.040, SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN NORMAL GRAVITY FOR US.
THERE IS A CORNICOPIA OF WILDLIFE AND PLANTS. THE PLANTS ARE SPINDLY
BRANCHES WITH SMALL DIAMOND SHAPED LEAVES, AND ARE APPEARED VERY
BUSHY FROM FAR DISTANCES. THE AREA IS VERY HILLY AND LITTERED WITH
THE TREES. BUSHES ARE ALMOST CROWN SHAPED WITH THE SAME LEAFS.
MOST OF THE LEAVES ARE COLORED PURPLE, DUE TO UNKOWN REASONS.
THERE ARE ALSO ANIMALS THERE. I'VE SPOTTED A BIRD, AND A QUADRIPED.
THE BIRD FLEW ONWARD, AND I COULD BARELY GLIMPSE ITS JADE FEATHERS IN
THE DISTANCE. THE QUADRIPED WAS SHAPED AS AN ANCESTRIAL VERSION OF
OURSELVES. IT WOULD MAKE ME RAISE QUESTIONS, BUT THEY ARE FOOLISH.
THE ATMOPHERE IS USUALLY STORMY, RAIN A CONSTANT DOWNPOUR.
IT MAKES THE GRASS GROW TO UNEXPECTED HIGHTS, BLOCKING VIEWS AT TIME.
(NOTES BY THRONUS DALVI, EPOC 6011:659.856.280.)
I WENT DOWN TO THE PLANET AT NIGHT TO SURVEY THE LAND ONCE MORE.
THE SKY IS NEAR BLACKED OUT BY CONSTANT CLOUDS, AND THE PLANT LIFE
IS GIVEN A BLACK AND WHITE COAT TO THE GRASS, AND A BLUE SHINE TO THE
BUSHES AND TREES. THE TEMPERATURE LOWERED TO 17.4 DEGREES C.
I DISCOVED A SMALL PEAK, GREAT FOR OBSERVATION AT SNC 351.46:-15.6.
I WILL CONTINUE TO OBSERVE THIS PLANET FOR A LITTLE WHILE LONGER.
(NOTES BY THRONUS DALVI IN EPOC 6011:659.883.449)
(EXPLORATION LOG, SNC 41.88: EPOC 6011:659.884.178)
I LANDED AT SUNRISE IN THIS SMALL LOCATION. THE TEMPERATURE IS AS
LOW AS EVER, HITTING 9.1 AT THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. THE PLANTS ARE
CHANGING FROM THEIR EERIE BLUISH LOOK TO THEIR MORE COMFORTABLE
PURPLE. THERE WERE NO CLOUDS IN SIGHT, SO MELDERITH COULD BE SEEN
EASILY OFF THE HORIZON. THE AREA I SURVEYED ACTUALLY CONTAINED A
SMALL CHASM, WITH MORE VARIED PLANT LIFE. THEY WERE A HYBRID OF THE
TREES AND BUSHES, BASICALLY PUT TOGETHER, MAKING A LARGER BUSH THAN
USUAL. I DISCOVERED NO WILDLIFE UPON EXPLORATION.
(NOTES BY THRONUS DALVI IN EPOC 659.884.378)
(EXPLORATION LOG, LQ 337.47, EPOC 6011.29.643)
I STILL MUST WONDER WHY I MAKE SUCH STRANGE MISTAKES. I WILL MAKE
CERTAIN THAT I WON'T LEAVE OUT MY LQ LIKE LAST TIME! ...OH WELL.
ANYHOW, TO MORE IMPORTANT MATTERS. THE EXPLORATION OF LILTANCE. WELL
FOR STARTS, I FOUND A SMALL CRATER AT SQC 17.36, DOWNRIGHT STUNNING
TO THE EYE. I DOUBT I'LL FIND SUCH A LUSH PLACE AS SO. THE TREES
WERE VERY ABUNDANT DOWN INSIDE, AND EVEN ALL AROUND. AND YET ANOTHER
INTERESTING PIECE, A PEAK. WELL, A LARGE HILL, MORE OR LESS, BUT
THE PEAK DOES DROP QUICKLY ON THE OTHER SIDE, SQC -69.-5. ALSO,
EXPECT TO SEE MANY BIRDS AND 'HOPPERS' AROUND HERE. ALSO, AFTER
MAKING SEVERAL EXPLORATIONS, I'M NOW CERTAIN THAT THE WHITE SPOTS
WE SEE IN ORBIT ARE JUST SIMPLE STORM CLOUDS. THE STRANGE THING
IS THAT I HAVE YET TO FIND ANYTHING RESEMBLING A SEA OR OCEAN YET.
THIS PLANET IS JUST PLAIN INTERESTING!
THIS PLANET WAS DISCOVERED BY THRONUS DALVI IN EPOC 6011:659.852.770.
THE PLANET HAS NO ATMOSPHERE WHATSOEVER, AND THE TEMPERATURES VARY
SIGNIFICANTLY. THE GRAVITY ITSELF IS VERY LOW, MESURING ONLY .239FG.
THERE IS NO PRESSURE EITHER. THE PLANET IS COMPLETELY BARREN.
(NOTES BY THRONUS DALVI, EPOC 6011:659.853.730.
THIS PLANET WAS DISCOVERED BY THRONUS DALVI IN EPOC 6011:660.30.269.
ITS A PLANET, BUT IT LOOKS LIKE A MOON. I SEEM TO HAVE NO INTEREST IN
IT. DUSTY, CRATERS, NO ATMOSPHERE, THE USUAL.
ONE INTERESTING NOTE IS THAT ITS THE LAST PLANET OF THE MELDERITH
SYSTEM. SINCE IT IS, THE TEMPURATURE MUST BE VERY LOW.
(NOTES BY THRONUS DALVI, EPOC 6011:660.30.506)
THIS PLANET WAS DISCOVERED BY THRONUS DALVI ON EPOC 6011:660.199.708.
THIS IS ACTUALLY, AND MUST BE, THE LAST PLANET OF THE MELDERITH SYSTEM.
HAVING SAID THAT, I NEED TO CORRECT A STATEMENT I SAID ON THE NOTES OF
THE PLANET PHONTS. THAT IS NOT THE LAST PLANET. THIS ONE, ALTYR, IS.
THE MOST NOTABLE FEATURE OF THIS PLANET IS ITS RING. VERY NICE, TO SAY
THE LEAST. ALTYR HAS ONE MOON IN VERY CLOSE ORBIT AND CAN GET A GOOD
VIEW FROM IT FROM THE SHIP ORBITING ALTYR. GRAVITY IS LOW ON THE PLANET
AND THERE IS NO ATMOSPHERE, AS USUAL. ITS QUITE COLD, BUT THAT SHOULD
BE EXPECTED.
(NOTES BY THRONUS DALVI, EPOC 6011:660.199.883)
THIS MOON WAS DISCOVERED BY THRONUS DALVI IN EPOC 6011:660.27.501.
THIS SMALL MOON IS THE FIRST MOON OF LILTANCE. THE GRAVITY IS BARELY
SUITABLE, ONLY BEING .184 FG, AND THE TEMPURATURE AT SUNSET WAS -12.4
DEGREES CELSIUS. THERE IS NO ATMOSPHERE, AND THE MOON IS COVERED IN
WHITE CAPPED MINERALS, ALMOST LIKE SNOW OR ICE.
THIS MOON WAS DISCOVERED BY THRONUS DALVI IN EPOC 6011:659.944.330.
THIS SMALL MOON IS CRATEROUS, HAS NO ATMOSPHERE, AND LITTLE GRAVITY.
IT MEASURES .020 FG ON AVERAGE, WITH TEMPERATURES DURING MORNING
STARTING AT 9.4 DEGREES C. THERE SEEMS TO BE NOTHING WORTHWHILE TO
VISIT THIS SMALL MOON.
(NOTES BY THRONUS DALVI, EPOC 6011:659.944.520)
MOON DISCOVERED BY THRONUS DALVI IN EPOC 6011:660.31.684.
THIS MOON IS THE FIRST MOON TO SELITH, A RATHER BARREN PLANET. THE
MOON ITSELF IS JUST AS UNINTERESTING, ONLY HAVING .057 ATM AND .590
GRAVITY. WITH A VERY THIN ATMOSPHERE, LOW GRAVITY, AND LOW
TEMPURATURES, THIS MOON IS AS UNINTERESTING AS MOST OF THIS SYSTEM.
(NOTES BY THRONUS DALVI, EPOC 6011:660.31.802)

FIRST MOON OF SOLACE.
THIS MOON WAS DISCOVRED BY THRONUS DALVI IN EPOC 6011:660.32.954.
THE SECOND MOON TO SOLACE. ACTUALLY QUITE NICE, COMPARED TO MOST
MOONS. QUAINT GREEN GLOW, AND THE SUN LOOKS NICE FROM THE SURFACE.
INTERESTING, AT MOST.
(NOTES BY THRONUS DALVI, EPOC 6011.660.33.8)
THIS MOON WAS DISCOVERED BY THRONUS DALVI IN EPOC 6011.200.306.
THIS SINGLE MOON ORBITING ALTYR IS UNSTABLE. THE MOON IS INTERNALLY
HOT, AND THE SURFACE CANNOT BE LANDED UPON. WITHOUT NO WAY TO LAND, I
CANNOT RESEARCH THIS MOON MUCH. IT IS, HOWEVER, ONE OF THE FEW PLANETS
THAT ACTUALLY ARE UNSTABLE. IN FACT, ITS THE ONLY PLANET HERE THAT IS.
(NOTES BY THRONUS DALVI, EPOC 6011.200.424)
DISCOVERED BY CAPT. CARLOS, ON 6011.602.873.220. VERY BEAUTIFUL
PLANET, ALTOUGH I COULDN'T LAND MY SD'S CAPSULE ON IT DUE TO IT'S
UNSTABLE SURFACE.
DISCOVERED BY CAPT. CARLOS, ON 6011.602.873.476. BULADEFOCUS IS
A VERY BEAUTIFUL PLANET, REMINDING ME OF A FIREBALL - HENCE IT'S
NAME, IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE ELDERS. HOWEVER, A CLOSER LOOK
REVEALED A BLUEISH HALO, WHICH APPEARS TO BE AN OXYGEN ATMOSPHERE.
DISCOVERED BY CAPT. CARLOS, ON 6011.602.874.324. OF THE PLANETS
VISITED ON THIS SYSTEM, THIS HAS BEEN THE MOST INTERESTING. IT'S A
SMALL ROCKY PLANET, WITH A VERY DENSE ATMOSPHERE. PRESSURE IN IT
IS OF UP TO 60 ATM. TEMPERATURES RANGE FROM -30 ON THE EQUATOR TO
-90 ON THE SOUTH POLE. THE SOUTH POLE IS, HOWEVER, THE MOST
INTERESTING PLACE ON THIS PLANET. SINCE THE AIR THERE IS LESS
DENSE, IT IS A NICE PLACE FOR PHOTOGRAPHERS. ANOTHER FEATURE OF
NIMBUS ROXO IS THE WHITE SPOT ON THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE. HOWEVER,
AVOID LANDING THERE, SINCE IT IS EASY TO GET LOST.
NIMBUS ROXO MEANS 'THE PURPLE CLOUD' ON THE LANGUAGE OF THE ELDERS
OF THE BRAZHNAV FAMILY.
NEXT NOTES BY BLADE TRAIN3R
HAVE BEEN TO THE SURFACE,AT THE EQUATOR THE PRESSURE IS 44.06!
WENT TO 50.103, SAW CUBELIKE OBJECTS AS LANDING AND THOUGHT THEY
WERE RUINS, WHEN I GOT THERE (-18.-17) WHAT I SAW WAS EVEN MORE
AMAZING THAN I HAD ANTICIPATED!IT WAS AN ENTIRE CLIFF MADE OF
HIGHLY REFLECTIVE CRYSTAL!A SIGHT WORTH SEEING, TRUST ME.
STAY AWAY FROM THAT FROZEN PLANET! IN THE 275:026 SECTOR, THERE
IS A *HUGE* RIFT. I SYATED A COMPLETE TRIAD SINISTER STUCK IN
THE BOTTOM OF THE RIFT. AWESOME VISIONS THOUGH. WHITE-PINK
ICEBERGS AND A PITCH BLACK SKY.
STAY AWAY TO LAND ON THIS PLANET AT YOUR OWN RISK.

THE SECOUND MOON OF PARSIS 3 IS ALSO DUSTY, CRATERIZED.
NOTHING OF INTEREST. (STARGAZER. EPOC 6011:495)
THE CLOSEST MOON TO PARSIS 6 IS, AS ITS HOST PLANET, VERY
UNINTERESTING. DUSTY, CRATERIZED. (STARGAZER. EPOC 6011:596:496)
TOUGH THE WORLD LOOKS STRANGELY FELISIAN, IT APPERS TO BE A
PLANETOID WITH THIN ATMOSPHERE. NOTHING OF INTEREST COULD BE
DETECTED UPON LANDING. (STARGAZER. EPOC 6011:596:496)
THE NEAREST MOON TO PARSIS 7 IS A WORLD MUCH LIKE GANYMEDE OR LUNA
THE MOON IS DUSTY AND CRATERIZED, BUT HAS A LOT OF ICE IN ITS MANY
CRATERS.
THE MOON IS ALSO LOADED WITH RADIATION FROM ITS HOST PLANET, MUCH
LIKE JUPITER.
(STARGAZER. EPOC 6011:596:573)
THE SECOUND MOON OF PARSIS 7 IS, BECOUSE OF ITS UNFORTUNATE ORBIT,
A VOLCANIC WASTELAND, MADE THAT WAY BY GRAVETATIONAL STRESS FROM
THE MAIN PLANET, AND THE OTHER MOONS.
LANDING IS INPOSSIBLE, DUE TO UNSTABLE AND HOSTILE SURFACE.
(STARGAZER. EPOC 6011:596:573)
THE THIRD MOON OF PARSIS 7, IS VERY MUCH RESEMBLING THE FOURTH AND
FIFTH MOON.
THIS MOON IS FULLY COVERED BY DARK CLOUDS, LANDING IS NOT ADVICED.
(STARGAZER. EPOC 6011:596:573)
THE FOURTH MOON OF PARSIS 7 IS, LIKE THE FIFTH MOON, FULLY COVERED
BY CLOUDS. MUCH LIKE TITAN AND VENUS.
(STARGAZER. EPOC 6011:596:573
THE OTHERMOST MOON OF PARSIS 7 APPEARS TO BE A CENUS LIKE WORLD.
FULLY COVERED BY CLOUDS, VERY DARK SURFACE AT SOME PLACES.
(STARGAZER. EPOC 6011:573)
THE SIXTH MOON ORBITING PARSIS 7, APPEARS TO BE A WORLD MUCH LIKE
THE JUPITER MOON IO.
GRAVETATIONAL STRESS HAS CAUSED THIS WORLD TO BECOME AN VOULCANIC
WASTELAND, WITH AN VERY UNSTABLE SURFACE, AND A LOT OF VOLCANOUS
AND LAVA STREAMS.
LANDING IS IMPOSSIBLE. (STARGAZER. EPOC 6011:596:573)
THE OTHERMOST MOON OF PARSIS 7, CAME AS QUITE A SUPRISE.
THE MOON ITSELF IS RATHER UNINTERESTING; DUSTY, CRATERIZED, NO
ATMOSPHERE.
(STARGAZER. EPOC 6011:596:573)
A MOON ORBITING IN EXTREMELY CLOSE RANGE FROM ITS MASTER PLANET.
THIS MOON WILL EVENTUALLY MERGE WITH ITS MASTERWORLD SOMETIME IN
THE FAR FUTURE.
THE MOON IS VERY MUCH LIKE LUNA; DUSTY AND CRATERIZED.
NOTHING OF INTEREST COULD BE FOUND UPON LANDING.
(STARGAZER. EPOC 6011:596:574)
THIS MOON CONFIRMS MY SUSPCION THAT PARSIS 9 IS ACTUALLY A BROWN
DWARF.
THATS THE ONLY WAY TO EXPLAIN WHY THIS MOON IS A GAS-GIANT!
THE GAS-GIANT SEEMS TO BE ORBITING ITS NOW-DEAD STAR AT AN
EXTREMELY NEAR DISTANCE. SO IT APEARS THE PARSIS SYSTEM IS ACTUALLY
A BINARY STAR SYSTEM, THE ONLY ONE OF ITS KIND. AN EL-DORADO.
(STARGAZER. EPOC 6011:596:574)
A WORLD WITH OXYGEN ATMOSPHERE, ORBITING THE SMALL, BROWN DWARF
PARSIS 9.
THIS WORLD HAS AN EXTREMELY DARK SURFACE AT SOME PLACES.
LANDING IS NOT ADVICED. (STARGAZER. EPOC 6011:596:575)
AN ICE WORLD WITH AN EXTREMELY SMOOTH SURFACE, INDICATING THAT ITS
PROBABLY FROZEN SOLID, WITH NO LIQUIED OCEAN OR ANY OTHER THINGS OF
INTEREST. (STARGAZER. EPOC 6011:596:575)
A WORLD MUCH LIKE JUPITER'S EUROPA, WITH LOTS OF CRACKS ALL OVER
ITS SURFACE, INDICATING AN LIQUID OCEAN BELOW THE ICE.
(STARGAZER. EPOC 6011:596:575)
MUCH LIKE THE FOURTH MOON OF THIS DWARF STAR, THE FIFTH MOON IS
COVERED WITH ICE, WITH CRACKS AND OPENINGS INDICATING AN LIQUID
OCEAN.
(STARGAZER. EPOC 6011:596:575)
LIKE ITS TWIN MOONS OF THE PARSIS 9 SYSTEM, THIS WORLD IS COVERED
WITH ICE, BUT HAS SIGNS OF AN ACTIVE OCEAN BELOW IT.
(STARGAZER. EPOC 6011:596:575)
A RATHER PINK OXYGEN PLANET, MAINLY QUARTS SURFACE, SOME

THE EIGHT MOON ORBITING THE ANCIENT AND COLD DWARF STAR PARSIS 9,
IS A ROCKY AND CREASED WORLD WITH NOTHING OF REAL INTEREST.

YET ANOTHER WORLD COVERED WITH ICE, WITH AN ACTIVE OCEAN WORKING
BELOW IT, INDICATED WITH HUGE CRACKS ON ITS SURFACE.
(STARGAZER. EPOC 6011:596:576)
AS MANY OF THE OTHER WORLDS ORBITING THIS COLD DWARF PARSIS 9,
THIS WORLD IS FULLY COVERED WITH ICE, WITH LOTS OF CRACKS ON ITS
SURFACE. (STARGAZER. EPOC 6011:576)
DUE TO ITS ORBIT AROUND THIS MINIATYRE STAR-SYSTEM, THIS WORLD
HAS BECOME A VOLCANIC WASTELAND, IN EFFECTS OF GRAVETATIONAL
STRESS.
LANDING IS IMPOSSIBLE.
(STARGAZER. EPOC 6011:596:576)

THE FINAL, I THINK, MOON OF THE PARSIS 9 DWARF SYSTEM, IS YET
ANOTHER ICY PLANETOID, WITH SOME NICE CRACKS.
(STARGAZER. EPOC 6011:596:576)
I DIDNT EXPECT TO FIND MOONS AROUND THE SMALL PLANETOID NAMED
PARSIS 10, BUT REMARKABLY, THERE IS MOONS.
THIS NEAREST MOON IS ORBITING AT SOME CLOSE RANGE, AND IS DUSTY
AND CRATERIZED. NOTHING OF INTEREST.
(STARGAZER. EPOC 6011:596:577)
THE FIRST MOON OF PARSIS 11 IS AN OXYGEN WORLD WITH A MAINLY
QUARTS SURFACE. NOTHING OF REAL INTEREST TOUGH.
(STARGAZER. EPOC 6011:596:656)
ANOTHER GAS-GAINT WORLD, PROVING THAT PARSIS 11 ACTUALLY IS A
STAR-LIKE OBJECT, POSSIBLY THE REMNANTS OF AN ANCIENT BROWN DWARF.
PARSIS 11.2 IS MOSTLY UNINTERESTING, TOUGH I DID SPOT A FEW STORMS
FROM ORBIT. (STARGAZER. EPOC 6011:596:656)
YET ANOTHER ICY PLANETOID ORBITING THE PARSIS 11 PLANET/STAR
HYBRID. SMOOTH SURFACE, NOTHING OF INTEREST.
(STARGAZER. EPOC 6011:596:656)

YOU HAVE PROBABLY GUESSED ALREADY THAT THIS IS ANOTHER ONE OF
THOSE ICY PLANETOIDS.
(STARGAZER. EPOC 6011:596:658)
IT WOULD APEAR PARSIS IS A TWIN-PLANET, WITH A MOON ORBITING AT A
EXTREMELY CLOSE PROXIMITY FROM THE MASTER WORLD.
MUCH LIKE PLUTO AND CHARON, ONLY THAT THESE WORLDS ARE SOMEWHAT
LARGER THEN THOSE.
THE MOON OF PARSIS 12, IS, LIKE ITS MASTER-WORLD, AN ICY PLANETOID
NOTHING OF INTEREST COULD BE DETECTED UPON LANDINGS.
(STARGAZER. EPOC 6011:596:658)
REALLY JUST AN ASTEROID COGHT IN THE GRAVETATIONAL FIELDS OF THE
TWIN PLANETS PARSIS 12.
AT LEAST, THIS PLANET HAS AN THIN ATMOSPHERE, BUT IT IS NOTHING OF
INTEREST (STARGAZER. EPOC 6011:596:658)
THE CLOSEST MOON TO THE PARSIS 13 GAS-PLANET, IS A WORLD WITH
A THIN ATMOSPHERE, AND CRATER-FILLED SURFACE.
NOTHING OF INTEREST WAS DETECTED UPON LANDING.
(STARGAZER. EPOC 6011:596:659)
DUE TO ITS PROZIMITY TO THE OTHER, MORE MASSIVE MOONS, THIS WORLD
HAS BECOME TEARED APPART BY GRAVETATIONAL FORCES.
ITS SURFACE IS TO UNSTABLE FOR LANDING.

THE PARSIS SYSTEM IS FULYL EXPLORED NOW, IT SEEMS, AND I WILL NOW
START THE LLONG JOURNEY BACK TO FELYSIA, TO GET A NEW STARDRIFTER

SPACE AFTER FLIGHT ON PARSIS COORDINATES
JUST A CRATERIZED MOON WITH BROWN SURFACE AND HILLS
AFTER SOME STARMAP INVESTIGTIONS I INVENT, THAT I REACH THOSE
MOON JUST BECAUSE MY PARSIS FLIGHT WAS TOO SHORT
ON ITS ISLANDS, THIS PLANET HAS BEAUTIFUL TREES WITH
TRANSPARENT BRANCHES. AT SOME PLACES THEY ARE SLANTED, PERHAPS BY
THE WIND. I HAVE ALSO SEEN SOME BIRDS.

PROMETHEUS IS THE FIRE GOD OF LIMBIAN MYTH, AND JUDGING BY THE...
LETTERS 'US' ON THE END OF HIS NAME IT APPEARS HE WAS SEEN AS A...
GOOD GOD, IF YOUR WONDERING WHY VISIT LIMBIS (ITS COLD!).
A GODESS OF BEAUTY, RECENTLY OUTLAWED BY SYICTHUS DUE TO HER UNDER-
GROUND FOLLOWING OF DEVOTED LIMBIANS, FOR MORE INFO LOOK UP LIMBIS.
GOD OF DEATH AND WAR AND JUDGING BY THE LETTER 'K' AT THE START OF...
HIS NAME HE WAS NOT ADMIRED BY THE PEACEFUL PEOPLE OF LIMBIS, LEGEND
HAS IT THAT HE AND RADIA HAVE OFTEN FOUGHT OVER MAGERRON (THE GROUND)
IN ROUGH LIMBIAN TEXTS, AND WILL MEET AGAIN FOR THE FINAL BATTLE!
THE GODESS OF THE HUNT, ON LIMBIS BOTH THE MALES AND THE FEMALES HUNT
AS IT IS THE ONLY SOURCE OF FOOD ON LIMBIS (TO COLD FOR ANY VEGETATION!)
THE MAIN STAPLE ON THE LIMBIAN DIET IS THE HAFIN (A SMALL BIRD THAT...
MAKES UP THE LARGEST PART OF THE NON-LIMBIAN POPULATION) MMM...YUMMY...
SEENA, IS NOT SEEN (PUN!) AS ONE OF THE POPULAR DEITIES AS HUNTING IS A
NESESSITY ON LIMBIS.
LIMBIS THE OLDER SON OF LOCTIS AND THE ONLY LIFE GIVING PLANET IN THE
SYSTEM, LIMBIS IS THE SEAT OF POWER OF THE RECENTLY FORMED LIMBIAN FED-
ERATE, LED BY THE GREAT MAN WHO BROUGHT THE WARRING TRIBES TOGETHER,
SYICTHUS THE THORN, LIMBIS AT THIS STAGE IS AT PEACE BUT THE MOVEMENT
IS ABOUT TO TEAR THAT PEACE APART, LIMBIS IS A FEUDAL PLANET, MANY
UNDER THE BANNER OF THE MOVEMENT WISH TO FORFILL THE GREAT VISION OF
KAPAR THE FOREWARNED AND START NEW LIFE ON LIESIS, BUT ENOUGH OF THAT
IF YOUR INTERESTED IN THE FULL STORY EMAIL DOCTORLYONS@HOTMAIL.COM ...
POINT OF INTEREST, MONS LIMBIS(THE ICE TOWER) WHERE THE GREAT CITY OF
DEUS LIMBIS IS ATOP, AT 255:58 IF YOU GET UP THERE TAKE A PHOTO FOR ME
;)
ON LIMBIS PLANTS ARE VERY RARE SO JAHAARI IS THE NAME FOR THE HIDDEN
GOD OF NATURE, OR AS THE LIMBIANS CALL HIM 'THE QUIET ONE'.
LIMBIAN MYTH HAS IT THAT A FRIEND OF LOCTIS GREW ENVIOUS OF THE ATTENTI
ON THAT LOCTIS GAVE TO HIS YOUNGER SON LIESIS, SO ONE DAY SINDAR GAVE
LIESIS FOOD WITH POISON IN IT, LIESIS DIED, LOCTIS WENT GRAY AND SINDAR
WAS BANISHED NEVER TO BE FORGIVERN.
LOCTIS'S SECOND SON, ONCE SAID TO BE MORE PERFECT THAN HIS FIRST, KILL-
ED BY SINDAR, THE SCROLLS SAY THAT ONE DAY THE CHILDREN OF LIMBIS WILL
BREATH LIFE INTO LIESIS, BUT THEN AGAIN SCROLLS SAY MANY THINGS.
THE GOD OF TRAVEL, WHO SAYS LIMBIANS DONT HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOR!
GOD OF EVIL, ON LIMBIS WHEN A CRIME IS COMMITED YOU CAN BE ASSURED THAT
THE GUILTY PARTY WILL SAY 'KALDER MADE ME DO IT!' KALDER HAS A SECRET
CULT FOLLOWING BANNED BY THE ELDERS, AND IS SAID TO BE THE GOD OF THE
MOVEMENT, ALTHOUGH THIS CLAIM IS LAID BY THE FEDERATE TRYING TO END IT.
WELL WHAT CAN I SAY, ALL GREAT ASTRONOMERS DESERVE I REWARD AND WHAT BETT-
ER REWARD THAN NAMING A PLANET IN YOUR NAME, BOK RITEA BORN; NOT SURE,
DIED; NOT SURE, HE NAMED ALL THE PLANETS EXCEPT SYICTHUS AND ITS MOONS,
TELESCOPE TOO SHORT YOU SAY? NO SYICTHUS USED TO BE NAMED MAHHARI HIDDEN
GOD OF ANIMALS AND WIFE OF JAHAARI BUT IT WAS RE-NAMED.
NOTHING MAKES YOU FEEL MORE IMPORTANT THAN RE-NAMING A PLANET AND A
FEW MOONS AFTER YOURSELF, AND THATS EXACTLY WHAT SYICTHUS FELT LIKE
DOING AFTER BECOMING THE RULER OF LIMBIS, ITS JUST ANOTHER FEATHER IN
HIS CAP REALLY!
THIS MEANS 'THE HALLOWED GROUND' IN LIMBIAN, IT HAS LONG BEEN THE...
WAR GROUND OF RADIA AND KLAMATAK, AND WILL BE FOR MANY AN EPOC!
GOD OF LIFE AND PEACE, THIS GOD BECAME FOUNDATION FOR THE RADIAN RELIG-
ION ON LIMBIS, AS A BITTER RIVAL OF KLAMATAK IT IS SAID BY MANY LIMBIAN
LORDS THAT THEIR POWERS BEING OPPOSITE COMPLETLY CANCEL EACH OTHER OUT
AND FURTHER MORE MAKE THEIR BATTLES A FUTILE ACT.
GOD OF DARKNESS, IN THE ANCIENT TIMES LIMBIANS CURSED HIS NAME WHEN
LOCTIS WAS BATTLED AND DAY BECAME NIGHT, WHO'S AFRAID OF AN ECCLIPSE?
WHEN SCIENCE ADVANCED ONE BRIGHT ASTRONOMER (WHO NAMED ALL THE PLANETS
IN THIS SYSTEM!) BOK DECIDED TO NAME THE PLANETS AFTER GODS, I'LL BET
THIS ONE MADE HIM LAUGH A LITTLE! :)
KALDER'S SECOND, IN LIMBIAN SOCIETY ALL THOSE WHO LEAD OTHERS HAVE A
SECOND WHO IS DEVOTED TO HIS MASTER (FIRST) AND IN RETURN IS KILLED WHE
N THEIR FIRST DIES (DONT ASK ME WHY ITS A REWARD?). :)
RE-NAMED BY SYICTHUS AFTER HIS CHILDHOOD NICKNAME WHICH HAS STUCK
THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE, ITS JUST PART OF THE PICTURE THAT YOU CAN GET
FROM DOCTORLYONS@HOTMAIL.COM
THE GREAT SECOND OF SYICTHUS THE THORN, ANGER IS A GIANT TO BE RECKONED
WITH, JUST TELL OFF SYICTHUS TO FIND OUT, ANGER CARRIES WITH HIM A 7FT

PLANET FOUND BY STARDRIFTER FRACTUS, EPOC 6011:571.188.
THIS IS ABARREN, BUT BEAUTIFUL ICE WORLD WITH MINIMAL LIFE.
THERE IS SOME ANIMAL LIFE ON THE SURFACE: JUMPING CAT-LIKE CREATURES AND
SOME BIRDS. SO FAR I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY TREES OR PLANTS OF ANY KIND.
THE TEMPERATURE ON THE SURFACE IS BELOW ZERO EVERYWHERE I LOOKED, SO
THE LAKES AND OCEANS HAVE FROZEN.

THE PLANET'S MOST VISIBLE FEATURE ARE THE GREEN STORMS IN THE THICK
ATHMOSPHERE. IN THE SURFACE, THE LIGHT FILTERING THROUGH THE CLOUDS IS
PURPLE IN COLOR, BUT UNDER THE STORMS, THE LIGHT IS BLUE, GIVING
EVERYTHING AN EERIE FEEL... CURRENTLY, THERE IS A LARGE GREEN STORM IN
THE EQUATOR. IT APPEARS AS IF THE PLANET HAS - OR IS - AN EYE, AND IS
LOOKING AT ME... AND THE UNIVERSE. WHAT WONDERS HAS THIS CELESTIAL
OBSERVER SEEN... I WONDER.

YET THE PLANET DOES NOT FEEL ALIEN... WALKING ON THE SURFACE I
ALMOST FELT LIKE I WAS INSIDE A DREAM... YET NOT ASLEEP.

YOU CAN FIND ICY, BARREN WASTELANDS AND SNOW PEAKED MOUNTAINS HERE,
AS WELL AS DENSE FORESTS WHICH ARE TEEMING WITH LIFE - RIGHT NEXT TO

THE SURFACE TEMPERATURES SEEM TO RANGE FROM AROUND -5C TO +45C.
THIS PLANET IS WELL WORTH EXPLORING!

I'M REALLY STARTING TO LIKE THIS STARSYSTEM, BY THE WAY... ALTHOUGH
I STILL HAVEN'T MANAGED TO FIND A SUITABLE NAME FOR THE MAIN STAR.

SOME MORE LOCATIONS.

MY FIRST FIND IS A LUCKY ONE A PLANET THAT SUSTAINS LIFE.
THERE WERE BIRDS IN THE SKYAND I SPOTTED A STRANGE BULL CREATURE.
THE BULL WAS SCARED SO I DON'T THINK THERE'S INTELLIGENT LIFE.

NOTE THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT MOUNTAIN RANGES COVERING WHAT
SURFACE THIS WORLD HAS- AKA 000:060. AT THESE COORDS, IT IS
POSSIBLE TO SEE THE WHITE AVIANS FAIRLY CLOSE UP.
NOTE THAT IN THE OCEANS, LARGE LINES ARE VISIBLE IN THE WATER,
WHICH UPON CLOSER INVESTIGATION ARE TRAVVELLING AT GREAT SPEEDS
PERHAPS THIS IS EVIDENCE OF MORE ADVANCED SUB-AQUATIC LIFE ON
THIS PLANET? IF ONLY WE HAD SUB-MARINE SURFACE MODUELS AT OUR

WHEN I READ 'CRATERIZED' IN DESCRIPTION - I DONT THINK ABOUT (THIS)
THIS PLANET WAS HIT BY SOMETHING WITH SIZE OF MOON. IN THE CENTER OF

ALSO IT HAS INTERESTING MOON, I WILL VISIT IT

BORING MOON THATS LOOK LIKE ONE WITH OCEANS AND FORESTS FROM ORBIT
OF ITS PARENT PLANET, BOREA
BUT IT HAS STRANGE SQUARE MOUNTAIN ON OO2-064, IN CENTER OF WHICH
THERE IS WAVY BLUE SURFACE, LOOKS LIKE STONED OCEAN
THE CLOSEST WORLD TO THIS WHITE DWARF STAR.
THE PLANET IS LOADED WITH RADIATION, AND HAS AN POTENTIAL
HOSTILE SURFACE DUE TO GRAVETATIONAL STRES.
IN EFFECTS; THE PLANET IS FULLY COVERED BY CLOUDS,
CAUGHT IN AN ETERNAL HELL.
LANDING IS NOT ADVICED.
(STARGAZER. EPOC 6011:596:493)
ONE MORE THING WHICH I FORGOT TO TELL: THIS PLANET HAS SOME
AMAZING RINGS, HUGE, BEAUTIFULL, SPETECULAR. EXTREMELY GOOD
PHOTO OPERTUNITY.
(STARGAZER. EPOC 6011: 596:493)
SUPRISINGLY A PLANET WITH OXYEGEN ATMOSPHERE, WHICH IS
RATHER RARE IN WHITE-DWARF SYSTEMS, BUT NOT IMPOSSIBLE.
ALSO THIS PLANET HAS SOME AMAZING PINK RINGS, WHICH MAKE UP
FOR SOME GOOD PHOTO OPERTUNITY.
SURFACE IS RATHER DULL; SOME MOUNTAIN RANGES, BUT NOTHING OF
REAL INTEREST. (STARGAZER EPOC 6011:596:493)
THIRD PLANET IN THE WHITE CORE SYSTEM, IS A DEAD, BARREN
PLANETOID. NO ATMOSPHERE, NO OXYGEN, NOTHING OF INTEREST.
APPART FROM THE BIG RINGS, THAT IS. THIS SYSTEM SEEMS TO
HAVE MANY OF THOSE. GOOD PHOTO OPERTUNITY AS WELL.
(STARGAZER. EPOC 6011:596:493)

SATURN. BEAUTIFULL PHOTO OPERTUNITY.

A WORLD ORBITING AT NEAR EXTREME RANGE FORM ITS DWARF-STAR.
AS THE 6TH PLANET, THIS WORLD IS A BARREN PLANETOID.
POSSIBLY A WANDERER BY THE LOOK OF IT. IT DOES NOT SEEM TO
BELONG TO THIS SYSTEM. (STARGAZER. EPOC 6011:596:494)
THIS HAS TO BE SOME KIND OF RECORD. THIS PLANET IS LOCATED WAY OUTSIDE
THE HELIOPAUSE OF THIS STAR, WHICH IS A TINY DWARF STAR.
THE PLANET MUST HAVE BEEN SHOT OUT OF THE SYSTEM WHEN THE STAR BECAME A
RED GIANT.
THE PLANET IS SUPRISINGLY FULLY COVERED BY CLOUDS! AND ON THE TOP OF THAT,
IT HAS SOME BEAUTIFULL RINGS!
I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING QUITE LIKE THIS BEFORE, BUT IT MUST BE ONE OF
THE MOST FAR-OUT WORLDS EVER DISCOVERED.
LANDING IS OF COURSE NOT ADVICED, AS YOU WILL GET LOST BEFORE THE CAPSULE
TOUCHES DOWN.

THE PLANET HAS FAIRLY GOOD GRAVITY, AROUND 0.8FG, AND SOME ATMOSPHERE
AROUND 0.011 ATMS. THE FIRST LANDING SITE WAS A HUGE PLAIN WITH SEVERAL
PLATEUS RISING FROM IT. AFTER A BIT OF EXPLORATION, IT SEEMS THAT THIS

STILL REMAIN ELUSIVE. RYAN GJK E6011,781.184
MADE 2 LANDINGS ON THIS THIN-ATMOSPHERE WORLD. NOTHING MUCH I CAN SAY,
OTHER THAN THAT THE SKY HAS SOME FASCINATING COLOURS. RYAN GJK
EPOC 6011.781.184
PROBABLY THE LARGEST FELISIAN OF THIS SYSTEM. VEGETATION PRIMARILY
PURPLE COLOURED. ALSO APPEARS TO HAVE THE MOST ANIMAL LIFE.
RYAN GJK E6011.781.188
A FELISIAN PLANET! LANDED AT 1,61 TO FIND GREEN GRASS AND
RED(!) BUSHES. NO ANIMALS THOUGH. PERHAPS IT'S STILL TOO
GEOLOGICALLY EARLY.
LANDED AT 2,100. DEEP GREEN GRASS AND TREES, WITH PARTIALLY
TRANSPARENT BARK. ALSO GOT QUITE A FRIGHT WHEN A HOPPER(!)
LANDED RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME. NO TIME FOR EXAMINATION THOUGH.
EPOC 6011 780.433
70,58 HAS MORE RED VEGETATION, BIRDS AND I GLIMPSED A
TINY HOPPER!
AT 285,66 I CAUGHT A BIRD AND SAW A SUNSET. NOT A BAD PLACE,
WITH GOLDEN BUSHES AND MANY BIRDS.
LANDED AT 77,94. THE TREES HAD THE SAME INTENSE DARK EMERALD
COLOUR. VISIT RECOMMENDED.
WOW, FOUND A REALLY SCENIC SPOT AT 92,13. IT HAS A DARK GREEN
GROUND AND DELICATE GOLD BUSHES BUT THE MAIN HIGHLIGHT OF IT
IS AN INLET OF THE SEA, OF WHICH PART OF IT IS IN A VALLEY.
GREAT PHOTO-TAKING SPOT.
LANDED AT 23,63. WAS RATHER HOT(39 DEG +). LANDED ON A HILLSID
E BUT ACCIDENTALLY FELL INTO A HOLE...NOT A DEEP ONE THOUGH.
COMPLETED MY QUICK TOUR BY LANDING IN THE POLAR LATITUDES.
FAIRLY AVERAGE BLUE GROUND WITH A YELLOW SKY AND A BIRD.
RYAN GJK E6011;780,790
LANDED AT 2,2 TO FIND COLD, RUGGED TERRAIN. RYAN GJK E6011.780.791
SOMETHING ABOUT THE NAME TOLD ME THAT THIS PLACE WAS GOING TO
BE PRETTY COLD! ANYWAY, LANDED AT 130,42. AT -9 DEGREES, THIS
WAS NOT THE COLDEST FELISIAN WORLD I'D SEEN...BUT THAT PLACE
WAS THE COLDEST I'VE SEEN WITH VEGETATION! SOME BLUISH SCRUB.
LANDED IN THE EQUATORIAL REGION, EXPECTINGSOME BALMIER
TEMPERATURES. I WAS WRONG! IT WAS -10.1 DEG, BUT STILL HAD THE
SAME VEGETATION! AMAZING!
WAS SURPRISED ONCE AGAIN
LANDED AT 121,57 ANDFOUND TREES AND 2 HOPPERS! ALL AT -10.1 C!
AT 121,61 I FINALLY FOUND ABOVE-FREEZING TEMPERATURES. ALSO
MADE AN OCEANIC LANDING. BEAUTIFUL BLUE SEAS.
139,45: SUMMITTED A FASCINATING ISLAND OFF THE COAST
141,24:11 DEGREES TEMP, ORANGEY ENVIRONMENT, SEVERAL BIG TREES
130,14:WONDERFULLY BRIGHT BUT COLD PLACE
AS USUAL, ENEDED MY TOUR WITH POLAR LANDINGS. THE TEMPERATURE
...UHHH...ANYWAY, RECOMMENDED LANDING SITES: 322,12 AND 124,1
RYAN GJK E6011.781.188
THICK ATMOSPHERE, SEVERAL BANDS AND A WHITE SPOT.
RYAN GJK E6011.780.432
INCONSISTENT PLANET WITH A LARGE RING FORMATION AND CLOSE SOLAR ORBIT
(TACKAT 6011:562.865)
CURSORY EXAMINATION SHOWS ONLY CRATERED SURFACE (TACKAT 6011:562.868)
WHAT APPEARS TO BE A POLAR CAP FROM ORBIT TURNS OUT TO BE A BRIGHT
PLAIN OF DUST. AND I MEAN BRIGHT! (TACKAT 6011:562.869)
CONTAINING 17 OF THE 19 CONSISTENT BODIES OF THE SYSTEM, IT IS BY FAR
THE MOST IMPORTANT PLANET. THOUGH INCONSISTENT ITSELF, IT DOES HAVE A
FAINT RING ARC WHICH IS MOST EASILY SEEN DURING ECLIPSE.
(TACKAT 6011:562.869)
CONSISTS OF PLAINS OR VERY SLIGHT ROLLING HILLS. ALL IN ALL, IT'S FLAT
THE ONLY ELEVATION WORTH MENTIONING IS IN 162.74 BUT THAT AMOUNTS TO
TO NOTHING MORE THAN A HILL. NO CRATERS ARE VISIBLE. THE YELLOW
ATMOSPHERE CONTRASTS NICELY WITH THE BLUE LANDSCAPE.
(TAKCAT 6011:562.870)
FURTHER EXAMINATION SHOWS IT TO BE LESS FLAT THAN I FIRST THOUGHT
(TACKAT 6011:562.945)
THERE IS AN IMMENSE PLATEAU IN 119.78. IT IS FIXED ATOP A GIANT
ELEVATION WHICH IS EASILY VISIBLE FROM ORBIT IN ONE OF THE LARGEST
CRATERS. (TACKAT 6011:562.945)
THE DENSE CLOUD COVER CASTS A GREEN HAZE OVER SURFACE EXPLOARTION BUT
MAKES FOR A VERY PRETTY ORBITAL VIEW. (TACKAT 6011:562.947)
MEDITATE ON IT TO GET +5 TO MANA - YOURS WINDETTA (MYSTICAL)
AN ATMOSPHERICALLY THICK PLANET. SURFACE IS EXTREMELY BLURRY AND
IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE MUCH.(NOTES BY JILANTY EPOC6011 569.11)
EVEN THOUGH THIS PLANET IS RELATIVELY DULL AND FLAT, ITS LARGE CRATERS
AND BEAUTIFUL STAR CAN PROVIDE FOR SOME NICE PHOTOGRAPHS.
(NOTES BY JILANTY EPOC6011 569.10)
THIS CLOUD-COVERED MOON HAS AN INCREDIBLE SIGHT AT COORDS 000:060
MOUNTAINS ARE CLEAR (SEE-THROUGH). THIS CANT BE ICE -- TEMPERATURE IS
AS HIGH AS 80C. (NOTES BY JILANTY EPOC6011 569.12)
THIS MOON HAS A THIN ATMOSPHERE, AND IS, ON THE WHOLE, RATHER FLAT.
(NOTES BY JILANTY EPOC6011 569.12)
THIS IS A FLATISH MOON WITH A THIN ATMOSPHERE. ATX237 SHINES QUITE
NICELY FROM THIS MOON'S SURFACE.(NOTES BY JILANTY EPOC6011 569.13)
MUST SEE COORDS 103:16. FROM THE SKY YOU WILL SEE A STRANGE PINNICLE
AROUND THIS THERE IS A VERY LARGE (NOT DEEP) IMPACT CRATER. WORTH A
GOOD LOOK.(NOTES BY JILANTY EPOC6011 569.14)
A CLOUD-COVERED MOON. THE 'BRIGHT SPOT' THAT IS VISIBLE FROM ORBIT IS
AN INCREDIBLE DARK AREA OF THE SURFACE. THE PRESSURE HERE IS QUITE
INTENSE -- OVER 100ATM. (NOTES BY JILANTY EPOC6011 569.73)
A NICE LITTLE PLANET TO VISIT, ALTHOUGH BORING...I DID FIND SOME
INTERESTING ROCK FORMATIONS THOUGH, AND THE CRYSTALS ON THE GROUND WERE
BEAUTIFUL WHEN LOOKED AT FROM THE RIGHT ANGLE,,,NOT TO MENTION THE HIGH
MOUNTAINS AND HILLS ALL THIS AT 324.61:-14.16 PLANET AND FORMATIONS
DISCOVERED BY BLAKE B. 564.187.103
NOT MUCH HERE TO TALK ABOUT A FEW WEIRD MOUNTAINS, BUT NOT
UNCOMMON, DISCOVERED BY BLAKE B. 564.187.656
NO LIFE DOWN THERE, NO SIR. PLANET RECEIVES ABOUT 20.2 KR FROM ITS
LYON'S PRIDE. ETERNALLY COVERED IN CLOUDS. VERY, VERY LARGE.
THIS DATA WAS RECORDED BY ELIOT LYON, 6011 560.722.981.
IS THIS A SYSTEM OF SUPERLATIVES? AEOLUS IS A SUBSTELLAR PLANET WITH A
SHOCKING YELLOW COLOUR. ITS ORBIT IS VERY CLOSE TO LYON'S PRIDE, MUCH
AS KEYSTONE'S IS.
THIS DATA WAS RECORDED BY ELIOT LYON, 6011 560.723.415.
ANOTHER HEAVILY CRATERED PLANET, SORMLAENG IS SURROUNDED BY A FINE
SET OF RINGS THAT LOOK MOST REMARKABLE IN THE DIRECT SUNLIGHT OF THE
RED STAR. IT SEEMS POSSIBLE THAT SOME OF THE MATERIAL IN THE RINGS
WAS IN FACT THROWN INTO ORBIT BY THE MASSIVE COLLISIONS THAT CREATED
THE CRATERS ON THAT MAR THE SURFACE OF SORMLAENG.
THIS DATA WAS RECORDED 6011 560.723.756.
THIS PLANET SEEMS TO BE VERY WELL-DEVELOPED. YOU CAN SEE EVIDENCE OF
THIS AT 8.98, AND ANOTHER PLACE THAT I SEEM TO HAVE FORGOTTEN...
DATA RECORDED BY ELIOT LYON, 6011 560.809.761.
THIS PLANET IS MOSTLY NOTABLE FOR AN ODD, PAINFULLY YELLOW STORM (?)
THAT IS ESPECIALLY VISIBLE WHEN ON THE DAY SIDE OF THE PLANET.
INITIAL STUDIES, INCLUDING LANDINGS IN THE CENTER, HAVE DETERMINED
VERY LITTLE, AND MORE INFORMATION IS REQUIRED.
DATA RECORDED BY ELIOT LYON, 6011 560.907.58.
FOR A MID-RANGE PLANET, THIS SURE HAS A LOT OF MOONS. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE
TO LAND ON THE SURFACE.
DATA RECORDED BY ELIOT LYON, 6011 560.738.18.
A GOD-FORSAKEN PLANET, CUE BALL'S SURFACE IS SO BLACK THAT ONE CAN'T
TELL WHERE SPACE ENDS AND THE PLANET BEGINS.
THIS PLANET ALSO SHOWS THE EFFECT OF MILLIONS OF YEARS OF COLLISIONS,
WITH 5 CRATERS THAT SEEM TO BE ALMOST AS LARGE AS THE PLANET ITSELF.
DATA RECORDED BY ELIOT LYON, 6011 560.722.615.
GLOOM IS THE BEST NAME FOR THE EIGHTH PLANET. THE CLOUD COVER BLOCKS
ALMOST ALL LIGHT, AND THE ROCKS GLITTER WITH A BLACK LIGHT. ON ANOTHER
NOTE, THERE IS A STRANGE BAND OF LIGHT COLOUR AROUND THE TOP OF THE
PLANET.
DATA RECORDED BY ELIOT LYON, 6011 560.736.996.
THIS IS VERY POSSIBLY THE BEST EXAMPLE OF A BIG, DIRTY SNOWBALL THAT CAN
BE FOUND IN THE SYSTEM LYON'S PRIDE. OTHER THAN THAT, THERE'S NOT MUCH.
DATA RECORDED BY ELIOT LYON, 6011 560.736.260.
THAT'S THE BIGGEST PILE OF USELESS ICE I'VE EVER SEEN!
DATA RECORDED BY ELIOT LYON, 6011 560.735.135.
ADDITIONAL: NICE RINGS, THOUGH.
THIS PLANET SEEMS AS IF IT COULD SUPPORT LIFE! IT HAS ICE CAPS, AND
IT EVEN RECEIVES SUNLIGHT...UNLIKE ALL THE OTHER PLANETS OUT HERE.
ALSO, AT 192,36, THERE IS A VERY INTERESTING 'MT. OBELISK'.
DATA RECORDED BY ELIOT LYON, SOME TIME AGO.
CORRECTION: THE OBELISK CAN BE FOUND AT 197,32.
THIS CRATERIZED PLANET HAS SOME OF THE MOST INCREDIBLE PRECIPICES IN
THE ENTIRE SYSTEM! THE WHOLE SURFACE IS COVERED WITH MASSIVE CRATERS!
DATA RECORDED BY ELIOT LYON, 6011 560.733.869.
NEMESIS IS DARK AND FORBODING ALMOST TO A FAULT. THE SKY IS GREY, THE
LAND IS BLACK, AND LIGHTNING STORMS APPEAR TO RAGE CONSTANTLY. ADD TO
THIS THE BALEFUL LOOK THAT THE MOONS SEEM TO BE GIVING THE PLANET, AND
ONE REALIZES THAT LIVING THERE WOULD BE BEST LEFT TO THE INSANE.
DATA RECORDED BY ELIOT LYON, 6011 560.728.451.
I CANNOT EVEN SEE LYON'S PRIDE FROM HERE! THIS IS WHAT DISTANCE TRULY
MEANS. MY INDOOR LIGHT IS THE GREATEST LIGHT SOURCE WHEN YOU GET OUT
THIS FAR FROM ANY REAL STAR.
THIS DATA WAS RECORDED BY ELIOT LYON, 6011 560.726.261.
HAS A REMARKABLE AMOUNT OF CLOUD COVER FOR BEING -180.4 C.
I MEAN, 40 AND A HALF ATMOSPHERES? JEEZ.
THIS PLANET HAS THE SINGLE MOST STUNNING
MONOLITH OF ANY. LAND AT 12,57, AND YOU WILL SEE THE 'CATHEDRAL
OF STORMS' -- A MAGNIFICENT EXAMPLE OF GOTHIC ART...CREATED BY
NATURE HERSELF. THIS SHOULD NOT BE MISSED.
DATA RECORDED BY ELIOT LYON, 6011 560.908.889.
VACCINIA, THE SECOND MOON OF CERULEAN, IS SURELY THE BEST PLACE TO GO
IN THE LYON'S PRIDE SYSTEM TO SEE HUGE CRATERS AND MOUNTAINS OF
UNIMAGINABLE SIZE BUTTED UP AGAINST ONE ANOTHER. THE MOST STRIKING
EXAMPLE CAN BE SEEN AT 191,35, WHERE A MOUNTAIN LOOMS OVER A MASSIVE
PLAIN CREATED BY AN IMPACT. THERE IS ACTUALLY A CRATER ON THE SIDE
OF THE MOUNTAIN THAT WOULD EASILY QUALIFY AS 'MAJOR' ANYWHERE BUT
VACCINIA.
DATA RECORDED BY ELIOT LYON, 6011 560.907.730.
NINE PINS LOOKS SUSPICIOUSLY LIKE A BOWLING BALL, AS IT HAS THREE
CLUSTERED CRATERS THAT STAND OUT. OTHER THAN THAT, THE ONLY THING
ON THIS PLANET (AS OF NOW) IS A SPIRE AT 171,49.
DATA RECORDED BY 6011 560.737.331.
THIS IS EASILY ONE OF THE FLATTEST PLANETS IN THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. IF
ANYONE CAN FIND AN INTERESTING PIECE OF INFORMATION ABOUT THIS, I'D
LOVE TO SEE IT, BUT I WON'T BELIEVE IT...
DATA RECORDED BY ELIOT LYON, 560.737.738.
IF YOU WANT THE MOON, YOU CAN HAVE IT. INITIAL SURVEY REVEALED NOTHING
INTERESTING IN ANY WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM.
DATA RECORDED BY ELIOT LYON, 6011 560.735.530.
THIS PLANET IS RATHER STRANGE -- THE GROUND IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO
SEE, YET SOMEONE APPEARS TO HAVE PLACED A SPIRE THAT REACHES TO THE
HEAVENS ON THE DARK SIDE OF THIS MOON. TRAVELLER, BEWARE: IT IS SO
DARK THAT IT CAN BE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND YOUR POD WHEN YOU GO.
DATA WAS RECORDED BY ELIOT LYON, 6011 560.731.508.
ADDENDUM BY PROF CALLAHAN... I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO LOCATE SAID SPIRE
ON THE DARK SIDE. IF IT IS REDISCOVERED, POST COORDINATES. -END
I HAVE DECIDED TO NAME THIS PLANET AFTER ITS DISTINGUISHING FEATURE,
A ROCK SPIRE THAT SEEMS TO BE VERY SIMILAR TO A FORMATION ON THE
SURFACE OF SENTINEL'S SISTER SATELLITE.
IT CAN BE FOUND AT -16,-90, BUT IT'S NOT WORTH COMING TO THE PLANET,
UNLESS OF COURSE YOU'RE TRYING TO TRACK A THEORETICAL ALIEN RACE...
DATA RECORDED BY ELIOT LYON, 6011 560.732.262.
ADDITIONAL NOTE: IT'S ALSO GOT A BUNCH OF CRATERS.
NOTE WELL: LAND AT 32,49.
THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING TO SEE DOWN THERE, BUT YOU'LL NEVER KNOW IT.
THIS DATA WAS RECORDED BY ELIOT LYON, 6011 506.726.990.

ODD PLANET, THIS. THE ENTIRE SURFACE IS TRANSLUCENT!
THE MOST ODD THING HAS TO BE THE TRANSPARENT MOUNTAINS...
YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE THE HORIZON LINE STRAIGHT THROUGH THEM.
ALSO, THE SURFACE IS DOTTED WITH OPAQUE CRYSTALS OF UNKOWN MAKEUP
HOWEVER, THERE ARE NO SIGNS OF LIFE ON PLASTIC WRAP.
(THIS PLANET WAS DISCOVERED BY AESIR IN 6011.626.???) ONWARDS!
FREAKY LOOKING PLANET, EH?INCONSISTENT WITH A BRIGHT GREEN GLOW...
I'D HAZARD A GUESS THAT IT'S RADIOACTIVE, JUDGING BY THE GLOW AND
THE INCONSISTENT MAKEUP. THE THICK CLOUDS SEEM TO REINFORCE THIS
THEORY AS WELL.
(PLANET DISCOVERED BY AESIR IN 6011.626.206) BOOYAH!
UM... IT'S DARK. REAL DARK. NO, REALLY.
I'LL PROBABLY BE ABANDONING MY SURVEY OF THIS SYSTEM, DUE TO THE
LACK OF MUCH-NEEDED LIGHT. THE MOONS, HOWEVER... WE'LL SEE.
(PLANET DISCOVERED BY AESIR IN 6011.626.206) WOOT!
ANOTHER PLANET OF GREEN DUST, JUST LIKE THE 5TH PLANET. BUT WITH ONE
EXCEPTION... THIS ONE IS COVERED IN CRYSTALS, LIKE 'IBME', GIVING IT A
GLOWING APPEARANCE FROM SPACE. ODD, *VERY* ODD, ESPECIALLY SINCE THIS
PLANET IS IN NO POSITION TO ACT AS AN ARTIFICIAL SUN, LIKE I HAD
ORIGINALLY THEORIZED FOR 'IBME'. THHIS IS STARTING TO MAKE LESS AND
LESS SENSE...
(PLANET DISCOVERED BY AESIR IN 6011.626.296) YEEHAW!
ABOUT THE NAME... NOTE THE MINTY GREEN TEXTURE OF THE SURFACE!
GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF LIGHT ON THE SURFACE, I'D HAVE TO SAY THAT THIS
IS THE PLANET THAT 'IBME' IS ILLUMINATING, MEANING THAT THERE'S A
FELYSIAN COLONY HERE SOMEWHERE. AT LEAST, THERE MUST HAVE BEEN ONE
AT SOME TIME; NEAR AS I CAN TELL, THERE'S NOTHING ON THIS PLANET
EXCEPT FUNKY GREEN DUST. THE FELYSIANS HERE MIGHT HAVE LEFT WITH THE
OTHERS IN THE HOME SYSTEM, BUT... WHY WOULD THEY TAKE THEIR COLONY
WITH THEM? ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER MYSTERY...
(PLANET DISCOVERED BY AESIR IN 6011.626.218) WOOHOO!
NEW THEORY... ORIGINALLY I HAD THOUGHT THAT THE COLONIES MIGHT BE
HIDDEN IN ONE OF THE LARGE CRATERS DOTTING THE SURFACE, BUT... THE
COLONIES MUST HAVE BEEN WIPED OUT WHEN THE ASTEROIDS THAT MADE THESE
CRATERS LANDED. SO MUCH FOR THAT...
(ADDITIONAL NOTES BY AESIR IN 6011.626.295)
ANOTHER REFLECTOR MOON; SAME PYRAMIDS AS 'IBME', SAME PATTERNS ON
THEIR SURFACES.
(MOON DISCOVERED BY AESIR IN 6011.626.297) FNORD!
OUCH; LOOKS LIKE THIS ONE TOOK MOST OF THE BLAST FROM THE ASTEROIDS
THAT RAVAGED THE 4TH AND 5TH PLANETS... A SURVEY OF THE SURFACE
MIGHT YIELD SOMETHING INTERESTING; MORE LATER.
JUST MORE CRYSTALS AND GREEN DUST. THE WHOLE SYSTEM MUST HAVE BEEN
WIPED CLEAN BY THOSE ASTEROIDS. NOTHING MORE OF NOTE HERE.
(MOON DISCOVERED IN 6011.626.297 BY AESIR) WOOT.
MAYBE THE ASTEROIDS WERE THE SOURCE OF THE GREEN DUST? T.
OUCH, IT DOES. NO, REALLY.
AFTER A SHORT SURVEYOF THE SURFACE, I'VE FOUND SOMETHING
INTERESTING... IT SEEMS THAT THE INTENSE GLOW OF THIS MOON
IS CAUSED BY STARLIGHT AND SUNLIGHT REFLECTING OFF SEVERAL
MILLION SMALL PYRAMIDAL STRUCTURES SCATTERED ACROSS THE
SURFACE. EACH STRUCTURE IS EXACTLY THE SAME, RIGHT DOWN TO
THE ODD PATTERNS ON THEIR SURFACES. THIS HAS LED ME TO
BELIEVE THAT THESE STRUCTURES MAY BE CAT-MADE; PERHAPS TO
TRANSFORM THIS WORLD INTO A SURROGATE SUN FOR SOME OUTER
COLONIES IN THIS SYSTEM. MORE EXPLORATION OF THIS AREA IS
RECOMMENDED.
(MOON DISCOVERED BY AESIR IN 6011.626.210) R0XX0R2.
ACTUALLY, THIS PLANET HAS VERY FEW INTERESTING FEATURES AT ALL. THE
ONLY THINGS I CAN SAY ABOUT IT ARE THAT, A, IT MUST BE AN ABSOLUTE
OVEN DOWN THERE, AND B, THAT'S QUITE A LARGE DEBRIS RING IT HAS.

DOWN THERE AND HAVE A LOOK AT IT, BUT FROM THE LOOK OF IT MY LANDER
WOULD BE SQUASHED LIKE AN ALUMINIUM BUG!

MOON DISCOVERED BY MRUQE; EPOC 6011-568.267
I FOUND SOMETHING REALY INTERESTING HERE.
IF YOU LAND IN THE COORDINATES: 144.107 (IN THR DARK SPOT IN A CRATER)
YOU'LL SEE A LARGE OBJECT TO THE WEST OF YOU. IT COULD BE A MOUNTAIN.
BUT WHAT IS A MOUNTAIN SO LARGE DOING IN THE MIDDLE OF A CRATEER?
THE MOUNTAIN IS HIGH, SPIKY AND IT LOOKS OUT OF THE PLACE.
ALMOST AS IF IT WAS A RUIN OF A GIGANTIC TOWER. (MAYBE IT IS? - MRUQE)
WEATHER THE VISIOR IS UP OR DOWN IT LOOKS THE SAME.

WELCOME TO DARK, MY LITTLE GET-AWAY RETREAT. FEEL FREE TO RELAX AND
STARE AT THE SKY ON THE NIGHT SIDE OF THE PLANET.
BEWARE ANY CHASMS YOU MIGHT FIND, BECAUSE THE EXTREME DARKNESS CAN MAKE
FOR EXETREMLY DIFFICULT TRAVELING.
PLEASE NOTE, THAT ON THE DAY SIDE OF THE PLANET, IT IS TWICE AS DARK AS
ON THE NIGHT SIDE OF THE PLANET.
I HAVE DECIDED TO MAKE THIS MY NEW HOME PLANET.
WHY ISN'T THERE A FLASHLIGHT BUILT INTO THE SPACE HELMET?
PLANET DISCOVERED BY JIM9137 EPOC 6011:581.790

FOURTH PLANET IN THE CELESTRA SYSTEM
ONLY PLANET IN THIS SYSTEM CAPABLE OF SUPPORTING LIFE
ORBITED BY FOUR MOONS
STRANGE SWIRLS VISIBLE FROM ORBIT, PERHAPS STORMS?
THERE IS LIFE ON LARANU, BOTH PLANT AND ANIMAL
THE DARK PATCHES ARE LARGE BODIES OF WATER, BEWARE OF SEASICKNESS
MANY HILLS ARE COVERED IN A BROWN VEGETATION
THOSE THAT ARE NOT SEEM TO BE AS TRANSLUCENT, MUCH LIKE ON LUMEN BETA
THESE HILLS ARE WHERE STRANGE, HOPPING ANIMALS CAN BE FOUND.
THESE TRANSPARENT HILLS ARE NEARLY CLEAR AND TEND TO REFLECT SUNLIGHT
ON THE DAYSIDE, THIS MAKES TRAVELLING DIFFICULT
ON THE NIGHTSIDE, IT IS POSSIBLE TO SPOT CANYONS WHILE THEY ARE DISTANT
THIS ALLOWS FOR INTERESTING PHOTOS
THE EFFECT ON THE DAYSIDE IS MUCH LIKE A MIRAGE
THE LAND BEGINS TO LOOK LIKE WATER, AND IT IS VERY DISORIENTATING
ON THE DAYSIDE, THE HOPPERS BLEND IN WITH THE MIRAGE TERRAIN
PERHAPS THIS IS A NATURAL FORM OF CAMOFLAGE?
AN INCREDIBLE ISLAND CAN BE FOUND AT 061.049
IT IS A ROUGH SWIM, BUT WELL WORTH IT
(XILOSCIENT EPOC 6011:571.616)
I HAVE RETURNED TO CATALOG MORE OF THIS PLANET.
THE BROWN FOLIAGE I OBSERVED BECOMES A GHOSTLY GREY/BLUE AT NIGHT
THE SWIRLS ARE DEFINITELY STORMS; THEIR WINDS CAN BE SEEN FROM SURFACE
THE STORMS LIKE TO TOSS SWIMMERS ABOUT, SO STICK CLOSE TO THE LANDER

SURFACE FEATURES ARE UNREMARKABLE
THE THIN ATMOSPHERE CREATES A BLUE HAZE
ALSO, THE SURFACE IS ODDLY TRANSLUCENT
I COULD SEE THE LANDING POD EVEN THOUGH A HILL SEPARATED US
THIS TRANSLUCENTCY ALLOWS THE LANDER TO REMAIN IN SIGHT LONGER,
BUT ALSO CREATES AN ETHEREAL SENSATION

LANDED ON A *VIOLENT* YELLOWISH SEA OF UNKNOWN COMPONENTS.
MOST OF THE DARK REGIONS ON THE SURFACE ARE LARGE BODIES OF
LIQUID. BE CAREFUL, YOU COULD BE EASILY EJECTED OF YOUR
CAPSULE. I TOOK PHOTOGRAPHS OF STRANGE LIFEFORMS LIVING IN THE
SEAS. THEY LOOK LIKE LARGE GRAY MANTAS.

AND THERE ARE FROZEN LAKES. TEMP. -72.9 DEGREES. AT 14.42
AT 14.42 IT'S DESOLATE AND BARREN. AT 342.81 THERE ARE SO MANY
FROZEN LAKES IT LOOKS LIKE A HILLY ARCHIPELAGO. (I DID A
DELIBERATE WATER LANDING AT 346.82 AND THE TEMPERATURE WAS +11

A SECOND LANDING SITE REVEALED NO ANIMAL LIFE BUT A BEAUTIFUL
ICE-COVERED FOREST.

LANDING AT 162:83 I'VE FOUND A NICE PLACE... THE GROUND IS COLOURED IN
PLEASANT SHADES OF ORANGE-BROWN, AT LEAST AROUND MIDDAY. AND THERE WAS
A HIGH, LONELY, ROUND MOUNTAIN TO THE FAR EAST OF THE LANDING SPOT,
FROM THE TOP OF WHICH THERE'S A PRETTY GOOD VIEW OF THE SURROUNDING
SEA. MANY GIANT PLANTS COVER THE PLAINS, WITH STRANGE BLUE BRANCHES.

THE SUN IS VERY, VERY LARGE DOWN THERE, BUT THE CLOUDS DO AN
ADMIRABLE JOB OF KEEPING IT DARK! MORE IMPORTANTLY, THERE IS A
LARGE 'DOUBLE IMPACT' CRATER (THOUGH IT IS POSSIBLY THE ODD CRATER
OF A VOLCANO) THAT CAN BE FOUND BY LANDING AT 24.30 AND WALKING TO
ABOUT -18,20. CAREFUL ABOUT NOT FALLING IN, THOUGH: IT CAN TAKE A
LONG, LONG TIME CLIMBING BACK UP THOSE SHINING WALLS.

BE WARNED! ONE SHOULD ALMOST EXPECT THE SKIES TO FALL UPON YOU ON THIS
PLANET, AS THERE SEEMS TO BE AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF GEOLOGICAL CHANGE.
I NAMED THE PLANET AFTER A GIGANTIC RIFT AT 358,49, BUT ON THE VERY NEXT
DAY THE RIFT HAD ALMOST COMPLETELY FILLED IN.

I MAY BE WRONG, BUT I THINK THERE IS LITTLE FAUNA IN THIS PLANET. IN
THE FEW TIMES I LANDED ON IT, I HAVEN'T SEEN MORE THEN A COUPLE OF
HOPPERS AND POSSIBLY SOME FISHES.
KAIRUS 6011 - 605.715.650
I FOUND THIS PLANET AFTER PLUVION, BUT BE SURE THIS ONE DESERVES THAT
NAME MORE, AS IT SEEMS TO BE RAINING EVERYWHERE I N THE PLANET. NATIVE
VEGETATION, BIRDS AND POSSIBLE FISHES. NO SIGN OF FELISIAN ACTIVITY.
KAIRUS 6011 - 605.715.481
WHO WOULD HAVE EXPECTED THIS INTERESTING INHABITED WORLD IN A NEWLY
BORN STAR LIKE AMATISTA? HOWEVER, HERE IT IS. I CALLED IT PLUVION AS
IT WAS RAINING EVERY TIME I LANDED ON ITS SURFACE, AND WHEN IT'S NOT
RAINING IT'S CLOUDED UP NONTHELESS. HOPPERS AND BIRDS ENCOUNTERED
ALONG ITS SURFACE AS WELL AS COPIOUS VEGETATION. HAVEN'T SEEN ANY
SIGNS OF THE FELISIAN CIVILIZATION, THOUGH.
KAIRUS 6011 - 605.664.316
IT DOESN'T SEEM MORE THAN AN ENORMOUS ICE DESERT WITH ISLANDS
SCATTERED EVERYWHERE, NONE OF THEM DESERVES TO BE CALLED CONTINENT
SO IT COULD REALLY BE A GIANT ARCHIPELAGO. SOME BEAUTIFUL SIGHTS
HERE, THOUGH I WOULDN'T CHOOSE IT TO RAISE A FAMILY. ONLY FAUNA
SEEN WERE SOME BIRDS, HAVEN'T FOUND ANY VEGETATION. MAYBE SOME
OTHER LUCKY EXPLORERS COULD FIND IT.

COME TO MIM, THE FROZEN PARADISE, ANOTHER STRANGE SON OF AMATISTA. LIFE
HAS MANAGED TO GROW IN THIS ADVERSE CONDITIONS, TOO, AS I COULD SEE MANY

SOMEHOW GROWS IN THE CONDITIONS, DESPITE BEING SO VERY FAR FROM
THE STAT OF WHICH THE MAIN PLANET IS SUPPOSED TO BE ORBITING.
AN ODD THING INDEED. ALSO OBSERVED: THIS PLANET APPARS TO HAVE

IT WAS COMPLETELY TRANSPERENT, YOU COULD SEE THE WATER
AND THE WAVES UNDER IT.
NOW GOING BACK DOWN THERE TO LOK FOR MORE STRANGE THINGS.
THERE'S ALSO SOME SPOOKY LANDMASS AT 270,16.
IT'S DEFINENTLY QUARTS, YOU CAN SEE THOUGH IT,
AND UNTO A STRANGE WHITE SURFACE...
I KNOW HAVE TO LEAVE THIS WORLD AS WELL;
FEEL FREE TO CONTINIUE MY EXPLORATION OF THIS VIERD PLACE.

HAVE TOO MUCH QUARTZ IN THEIR DIET :) AT 6.60 AS YOU LAND YOU'LL
NOTICE THE UNUSUAL RIDGES OF THE GROUND; HOWEVER, IT'S NOT THAT
SEVERE AND MOSTLY GRASSY WITH SOME BUSHES AND SCRUB PLANTS. AT 18.81
I FOUND MOSTLY LOW BUSHES, THOUGH THERE APPEARS TO BE FORESTS ON THE

HOPPER THERE. A BIG BLACK ONE. IT FIT THE DESCRIPTION OF
THE ONES ON CONSTANT. AT 249.84 THE SKYLINE IS DOMINATED BY
AN UNUSUAL PEAK. I TRIED TO GET NEAR BUT HECK I'M NO YOUTH.

THOUGH THERE IS A BIG MOUNTAIN IN THE DISTANCE, AND HERE I HAD
A BIRD LAND SO CLOSE I ALMOST HAD BIRD FRICASSEE FOR DINNER.

THERE ONCE WAS A MONASTERY, WHERE YOUNG MONKS DEDICATED THEIR
LIFES TO MEDITATION IN SEARCH FOR THE MEANING OF LIFE.
A YOUNG MONK HEARD ONCE, A CONVERSATION BETWEEN HIS TEACHERS.
FROM THAT CONVERSATION HE FOUND OUT ABOUT AN IMMORTAL WISEMAN WHO
LIVED ON THE TOP OF THE HIGHEST MOUNTAIN. HE DECIDED TO QUIT HIS
MEDITATIONS ANG GO THERE. AND SO HE DID. HE TRAVELED FOR SEVEN
YEARS JUST TO REACH THE HIGHEST MOUNTAIN. HE LIVED THROUGH MANY
DANGERS. MORE THAN ONCE HIS LIFE WAS IN A SERIOUS QUESTION.
IT TOOK HIM ONE MORE YEAR TO CLIMB THE MOUNTAIN. HE NEARLY HAVE
DIED OF COLD AND HUNGER. BUT HE DID REACH HIS GOAL. HE FOUND THE
IMMORTALS FORTRESS. WHEN HE WAS TRYING TO GET IN, A TERRIBLE TWO-
HEADED MONSTER ATTACKED HIM. HE KILLED HIM, BUT IN THE FIGHT HE
LOST AN EYE AND THREE OF HIS FINGERS. BUT THE WAY WAS FINALY FREE
-WHY ARE YOU HERE? - ASKED THE IMMORTAL WISEMAN.
- I CAME HERE TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE MEANING OF LIFE.
- AH... THE MEANING OF LIFE. WELL... LIFE, YOU SEE, IS LIKE A
HANDFUL OF CHERRIES.
- WHAT? I CAME ALL THAT WAY, AND FACED SO MANY DANGERS JUST TO
HEAR THAT
'LIFE IS LIKE HANDFULL OF CHERRIES'?!?

HE RULED MANY HUNDRED OF CITIES WITH A STRONG HAND.
ONE DAY, HE HEARD ABOUT A WISEMAN LIVING ALONE ON ONE OF HIS
PLANETS. HE SEND HIS GUARDS TO FETCH THIS OLD MAN AND BRING
HIM BACK TO THE IMPERIAL PALACE. AND SO THEY DID.
-HOW CAN I SERVE YOU, MY LIEGE? - ASKED THE PHILOSOPHER.
- IF YOU TRULY ARE THE WISEST MAN IN MY EMPIRE, YOU CAN TELL
ME THE GOLDEN MAXIM, THAT CAN BE USED IN ANY SITUATION IN
LIFE. - REPLIED THE EMPEROR.
- THIS IS A VERY HARD QUESTION, MY LORD. I HAVE TO THINK
ABOUT THE ANSWER. PLEASE, SEND ME BACK HOME AND SEND FOR ME
AFTER A YEAR PASES.
- VERY WELL - SAID THE EMPEROR - IT WILL BE AS YOU SAY.
THE WISE MAN THOUGHT ABOUT THE GOLDEN MAXIM FOR A YEAR.
HE WAS THINKING ABOUT THE HARD SITUATION HE WAS INTO.
HE KNEW, THAT IF HE DOESN'T FIND THE ANSWER, THE EMPEROR WILL
SEND HIM TO HIS DEATH.
AFTER A YEAR, WHEN THE GUARDS CAME FOR HIM, HE STILL DIDN'T
KNOW THE ANSWER. THEY TOOK HIM TO THE PALACE WHERE THE RULER
WAS WAITING. THE WISE MAN FELT, THAT THIS IS THE END OF HIS
LIFE. THEN, SUDDENLY, HE KNEW WHAT THE GOLDEN MAXIM WAS.
-WELL, DID YOU FIND THE ANSWER, OLD MAN? DO YOU KNOW A MAXIME
THAT CAN BE USED IN ANY SITUATION IN LIFE?
- YES, MY LORD.
-WHAT IS IT THAN?

FINALLY WE HAVE FOUND SOMETHING INTERESTING. OUR HISTORIANS HAVE
COMPARED THIS SYSTEM WITH AN ANCIENT STARMAP CREATED BY THE STARGATE
PROSPECTORS IN PRE-EPOC TIMES, AND WE HAVE FOUND SOMETHING ASTOUNDING
THIS WORLD HAS BEEN VISITED BEFORE BY PARSIS URSURIALIS HIMSELF, THE
FATHER OF THE VIMANA-DRIVES, AND THE FIRST REAL STARDRIFTER!
THIS WAS THE WORLD THEY DISCOVERED ON THEIR 4TH TRIP. A PARADISE-
LIKE WORLD IN A S09 SYSTEM. STARMAPS HAVE PROVEN THIS REALLY IS THE
HISTORIC WORLD. OUR AWAY TEAM HAS FOUND THE SAME AS PARSIS AND HIS
CREW FOUND FOR -7011 EPOCS AGO. A PARADISE-LIKE WORLD.
THE SURFACE OF THIS WORLD SHOWS HEAVY BOMBARDMENT FROM SPACE WITH
DRAKHNATOR WEAPONS. THAT THIS WORLD IS ONCE AGAIN A FELISIAN PARADISE
IS A MIRACLE. SURFACE EXPLORATION IS STILL COMMECNING. THIS IS A
INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFULL WORLD, CHALLENGING THE BEAUTY OF SURICRASIA
ITSELF. THIS WORLD IS DEFFINENTLY RECOMENDED FOR EVERY STARDRIFTER.
AND THE FACT THAT PARSIS HIMSELF ONCE WAS ON THIS VERY WORLD, MAKES
IT FEEL EVEN MORE SPECIAL, AS IF HIS SPIRIT IS STILL DOWN THERE.
FURTHER NOTES: WE HAVE FOUND A STRANGE ANOMALIE AT 339.05. IT SEEMS
TO BE THE 'ICE-CASTLE' DESCRIBED BY PARSIS AND HIS CREW FOR MANY
COUNTLESS EPOCS AGO. THE STRUCTRE IS DEFFINENTLY ARTIFICIAL IN DESIGN
THIS PROVES THAT ALSO THIS WORLD IS A WORLD OF THE ANCIENTS. ONLY
THEY COULD HAVE BUILD THIS STRUCTRE.
THE STRUCTRE APPEARS TO BE THREE SPIRES IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO
EACHOTHER. THEY HAVE CRUMBLED AND BEEN GRADIALLY DESTROYED OVER THE
EPOCS, AND NOW THEY ONLY SEEM TO BE MOUNTIANS WHEN SEEN FROM A LONG
DISTANCE. CLOSER INSPECTIONS SHOW THAT THIS IS INDEED A ARTIFICIAL
STRUCTURE. MORE RESEARCH IS REQUIRERED TO PROVE THIS TOUGH, AND SINCE
THE FALCORI IS A EXPLORATION VESSEL, WE CAN NOT STAY HERE FOR TO
LONG. WE WILL HAVE TO MOVE ON NOW, TO OTHER WORDS IN OUR SEARCH FOR
THE LEGENDARY ANTYREN.
WE NOW LEAVE THIS PLACE OF WONDER FOR OTHER STARDRIFTERS TO VISIT.
(STARGAZER. EPOC 6011; 585.142)
THIS MOON GOT ITS NAME FORM THE MELODY I WAS LISENING TO WHILE
LANDING ON IT.
PLANET IS A DEAD MOON OF THE 6TH PLANET OF THE DRAKHNATORIA
SYSTEM. STRANGE, BLUE SURFACE DETECTED UPON LANDING, MULTIPLE
CRATERS, SOME MOUNTAIN-FORMATIONS.
(STARGAZER. EPOC 6011; 585.343.274)
THIS IS IT, THIS IS THE MAIN PLANET IN DRAKHNATORIA.
THIS LITTLE MOON AS THE HOME OF THE DRAKHNATOR FORCES

ALL SYSTEMS ARE ON RED ALERT WHILE OUR AWAY-TEAM
INVETSIGATES THIS PLANET.
FURTHER NOTES: THIS IS THE MAIN PLANET ALL RIGHT.
DRAKHNAOTR SPIRES AND TUNNEL-ENTRESES DETECTED.
ALL CRUMBLING BY AGE. NO ACTIVITY HAS BEEN DETECTED SO FAR.
AVARAGE SURFACE TEMPERATURE IS -255 DEGREES,
PRESSURE IS 0.265 ATM.
GRAVITY IS 0.200 FG.
THIS PLANET IS JUST THE WAY THE DRAKHNATOR LIKE IT.
IT IS DEFFINENTLY DRAKHNATOR-FORMED, WHICH CAN BE SEEN FROM
THE MOONS MANY CRATERS, CAUSED BY WEAPON-FIRE AND ANCIENT
METEORITES.
NO RECENT DRAKHNATOR ACTIVITY CAN BE FOUND.
SURFACE EXPLORATION NOTES:
WE HAVE FOUND A COLLAPSED DRAKHNATORIAN TUNNEL LEADING TO A
SPIRE AT 337.025.
AN ABANDONED AND COLLAPSED DRAKHNATOR-HIVE CAN BE FOUND AT
342.084. CAUTION IS ADVICED WHEN EXPLORING IT.
OUR MISSION IN THIS SYETM IS NOW COMPLETE, DRAKHNATIORA IS
NOW FULLY EXPLORED AND MAPPED. WE NOW HAVE TO LEAVE THIS
SYSTEM FOR FUTURE EXPLORERS.
WE NOW HEAD BACK OUT INTO SPACE TO CONTINIUE OUR SEARCH FOR
ANTYREN. (STARGAZER. EPOC 6011; 585.425.140)

TOUGH NOT A ICY WORLD LIKE THE OTHERS, THIS WORLD IS NOT MORE
INTERESTING THEN THE OTHER ONES. (STARGAZER. EPOC 6011; 585.341)
NO, THIS CANT BE. ITS IMPOSSIBLE! WE HAVE DISCOVERED A FELISIAN
WORLD AT THE VERY OUTSKIRTS OF THE DRACHNATORIA SYSTEM. BUT IT
SHOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE! THIS CANT BE RIGHT. I MEAN; AT THIS DISTANCE,
THIS WORLD SHOULD BE FROZEN SOLID, LIKE THE OTHER FARMOONS. BUT
STILL; THIS IS A LIVING WORLD! A MIRACLE TO SAY THE LEAST. SURFACE
EXPLORAITON WILL START IMIDIETLY.
THIS WORLD IS FELISIAFORMED, ITS THE ONLY WAY THIS COULD BE
POSSIBLE. THIS SYSTEM IS DEFFINENTLY A PREVIOUS HOME OF THE ANCIENTS
TWO FELISIAN WORLDS THAT HAS SOMEHOW SURVIVED THE DRAKHNATOR-TIME.
INCREDIBLE!
UPON LANDING, WE FOUND A BIG FORREST OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS, ALL
LUMINATED BY A MYSERIOUS LIGHT. THERE ARE NO SUN IN THE HEAVENS, BUT
STILL, THE SURFACE OF THIS PLANET IS AS BIRGHT AS THE ONE OF
LUMINA 0.
AVARAGE SURFACE TEMPERATURE IS 10 DEGREES OR MORE. GRAVITY IS 0.800
FG. PRESSURE IS ABOUT 1.000 ATM.
THE HEAT IS POSSIBLY GEO-THERMIC, BUT THIS TILL DO NOT EXPLAIN THE
STRANGE LIGHT OF THIS PLANET. WE HAVE DETECTED SEVERAL PITS, AND
CRATERS, CREATED BOTH WITH METEORITES, AND DRAKHNATOR-WEAPONS.
NO ANOMALIES HAVE YET TO BE DISCOVERED, BUT SURFACE EXPLORATION IS
STILL COMMENCING. THE PLANET IS QUITE BEAUTIFULL AT SUNRISE AND SET.

CABARIS'S ATMOSPHERE IS A CHOKING COCKTAIL OF METHANE AND OTHER DEADLY
GASSES KEPT AT AN ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE 32 TIMES (!) AS DENSE AS
FELYSIA'S. SURFACE TEMPERATURES PEAK AT -102 DEGREES CELCIUS DURING
MIDDAY ON THE SUNLIT SIDE; THIS IS LARGELY BECAUSE OF CABARIS'S
EXTREMELY THICK CLOUDLAYER, WHICH BLOCKS OUT ALL THREE OF THE SYSTEM'S
SUNS-- EXCEPT FOR A FEW MOMENTS DURING NOON, WHEN THE 3RD SUN, BEING
THE CLOSEST, PIERCES THE VEIL FOR A BRIEF TIME TO ILLUMINATE THE
OTHERWISE PERPETUALLY-DARK PLANET.
MY TIME ON CABARIS WAS NOT FUN; I NEARLY LOST MY CAPSULE IN THE
SWIRLING METHANE STORMS THAT SWEEP THE SURFACE.
IF YOU PLAN ON LANDING, DON'T BOTHER BRINGING A TISSUE TO CLEAN YOUR
VISOR-- TRY A MOP.
-ENTRY BY RIVVEC PAULAVI, EPOC 6011.
I STOOD ON THE EDGE OF THE MOST GIGANTIC CRATER I HAD EVER
SEEN-- COORDINATES 240.54:-26.15-- AND WATCHED THE SUNRISE.
IT WAS A THRILL ONLY EXCEEDED WHEN A SUDDEN MISSTEP FLUNG ME FROM THE
LEDGE I'D BEEN STANDING ON AND INTO THE CRATER.
FORTUNATELY, THE PLANET HAS ONLY 20% FELYSIAN GRAVITY. :)
I ENJOYED A LENGTHLY PERIOD OF FALLING BEFORE CLAWING MY WAY BACK UP...
...AND THEN THROWING MYSELF OFF AGAIN.

DESCENT TO THE SURFACE: 'I WANT MY MOMMY!!!!!'... I WAS MOSTLY
CORRECT. IT'S PRETTY DARK DOWN THERE, NEED FLASHLIGHT. AT 336.60
IT'S FORESTED HILLY LAND WITH SHRUBS. I SIGHTED A HOPPER (YES! ON
MOON #2 OF PLANET 12!) AS I WAS LANDING BUT IT DISAPPEARED. NOTED AN
UNUSUAL SHAPE OFF TO THE SOUTH AS I WAS LANDING, IT PROVED TO BE A
DEEP CHASM. WITH ME, GO FIGURE. AT 2.41 THERE WERE SOME OFFSHORE
ISLAND TO THE NORTH AND SOUTH BUT ON THE LARGER MAIN LAND I LANDED
ON IT WAS MOSTLY ROLLING WITH SHRUBS, AND A GRAYISH-PURPLE HOPPER.
AT 334.92 NEAR A BAY (OR COVE OR WHATEVER) THERE WAS HILLY GROUND

A FELISIAN MOON! NAMED BY PREVIOUS EXPLORER, BUT NO NOTES WERE MADE. I'M
GOING TO CHANGE THIS. EXPLOARION BEGINS...
5.60 - DENSE EQUATORIAL FOREST, BUT SOMEWHAT COLD FOR THE EQUATOR - ONLY
6 CELSIUS. LEAVES WERE GREEN, AND TRUNKS OF TREES... DIFFICULT TO
DESCRIBE, BUT THEY WERE AMAZING. I'VE ALSO SPOTTED FEW BIRDS. NO HOPPERS.
346.34 - WARMER THAN AT THE EQUATOR, BUT TREES AND SKY SEEMED RATHER...
UNATTRACTIVE HERE. STILL NO MAMMALS.
2.6 - EXTREMELY COLD. SOME FROZEN LAKES IN THE DISTANCE.
51.70 - LITTERED WITH LAKES. SPARSELY GROWING BUSHES AND SOME BIRDS WERE
ALSO PRESENT. I'VE FINALLY GLIMPSED A CAT-LIKE CREATURE.
68.85 - DENSE FOREST. I'VE WATCHED RISING (SETTING? I REALLY DON'T KNOW.
MY COMPASS STATED THAT SKYFIRE IS TO THE NORTH!) STAR. NOT TOO IMPRESSIVE
. SERPENS, 6011 665.790

SERPENS, 6011 665.842
A FELISIAN MOON, NAMED BY PREVIOUS EXPLORER. LOOKS STORMY.
136.63 - TURNS OUT THE MASS AND ATMOSPHERE ARE VERY SIMILAR TO FELISIAN

297.69 - QUITE DARK HERE. AGAIN, HILLY AND BARREN. SPOTTED SOME BIRDS.
301.27 - JUST WATER, BUT I'VE SPOTTED A FLYING CREATURE. STRONG WINDS.
335.119 - SUNSET AT A POLE. NOT TOO SPECTACULAR, SADLY...
107.51 - SUNRISE DURING A STORM THIS TIME. NICE, BUT STILL NO SIGNS OF
PLANT LIFE...
134.64 - AGAIN, BARREN AND HILLY GROUND.
0.60 - THE LAST ATTEMPT, AND FINALLY - THERE WAS A DENSE FOREST. I
DIDN'T SEE ANY HOPPERS ON THE PLANET. AVERAGE TEMPERATURE IS QUITE HIGH
, BUT LIFE'S NOT COMMON. SERPENS, 6011 665.843

ANOTHER FELISIAN MOON, THIS TIME NAMED BY MYSELF. PREVIOUS
STARDRIFTER MUST'VE ABADONED THE SYSTEM AT THIS POINT.
THE MOON HAS A BEAUTIFUL APPEARANCE FROM ORBIT. SOME LARGE BODIES
OF WATER DETECTED.
283.45 - IT SEEMS THAT THE NICE COLOUR FROM ORBIT IS CAUSED BY
ICE! THE TEMPERATURE WAS -105 CELSIUS, EVERYTHING FROZEN AND
LIFELESS. NOT GOOD...
0.57 - TEMP. WAS SLIGHTLY ABOVE 6 CELSIUS. I LANDED IN THE MIDDLE
OF DENSE FOREST. TREES WERE VERY LARGE AND RATHER STRANGE. STILL
NO ANIMALS. LOOKS LIKE LIFE IS POSSIBLE HERE ONLY AT NEAR
EQUATOR AREAS, BUT I NEED TO CONFIRM THIS.
352.60 - LANDED IN THE MIDDLE OF WATER. I'VE SEEN AN INTERESTING
LIFEFORM - BOTH AQUATIC AND AVIAN. THERE'S ALSO A NEARBY ISLAND,
SEEMINGLY BARREN, BUT YOU WILL SEE THAT IT'S GRASSY AND FULL OF
BRUSHES. THE WATER IS, UNFORTUNATELY, RATHER UGLY IN COLOUR AS
SEEN FROM FAR AWAY. ALL THIS HAPPENED DURING A STORM.
359.87 - LOOKS LIKE I'VE STRAYED TOO FAR IN SEARCH FOR LAND
ANIMALS. BLEAK AND DARK GROUND, FREEZING COLD. I'VE STILL SPOTTED
A BIRD HERE, THOUGH...
94.60 - OH, MY... -72 CELSIUS AT THE EQUATOR.

ALSO OBSERVED BIRDS, AND SUSPECT OTHER ANIMALS AS WELL.

THE SECOND LIFE BEARING PLANET IN THIS SYSTEM! DUE TO ITS DISTANCE
FROM THE SUN, THEMPERATURE IS BELOW -100 DEGREES, AND THERE IS A
CONSTANT DUSK, PUTTING A DARK BROWN SKY ABOVE THE PURPLE GROUND.
AFTER SEVERAL LANDINGS, I HAVE DISCOVERED SMALL LAKES, BUT NO
VEGETATION. STRANGE, SINCE ANIMALS ARE ABUNDANT. SO FAR I HAVE
SPOTTED BIRDS, AND A STRANGE FOUR-LEGGED CREATURE WHICH USED ITS
HIND LEGS AND POWERFUL TAIL TO HOP ABOUT.
I HAVE FOUND A VERY INTRIGUING GEOLOGICAL FORMATION AT 52.61:-13.18
IT LOOKS LIKE A RING OF BLOCKY, PYRAMID-LIKE MOUNTAINS SURROUNDING A
LARGE MOUNT IN THE MIDDLE. IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE ANYTHING BUILT BY
FELISIANS, BUT I STILL WONDER IF IT IS JUST A WEIRD NATURAL
FORMATION, OR THE REMAINS OF SOMETHING... ELSE. (NOTES BY FARAGO,

A PLANET OF PRIMARILY GREY STONE. TEMPERATE CLIMATE AND OTHERWISE
PLEASANT ENVIRONMENT WITH ABUNDANT WATER.
THERE ARE GRASSLANDS IN THE EQUATORIAL REGIONS OF THE PLANET, POPULATED
BY FLAT TREES, PALE GREEN GRASS, AND SMALL BIRDS.
AT 035:022, FOUND A FOREST OF SHORT TREES WITH THICK TRUNKS AND
BRANCHES EXTENDING UPWARDS.
142.90 IS LOCATED ALONG THE COAST. IT IS A GRASSY AREA WITH A FEW
BUSHES SCATTERED AROUND.
AT 46.6 IS AN AREA OF ISLANDS AMIDST A FROZEN SEA. THE ISLANDS ARE
POPULATED BY CATLIKE ANIMALS AND A FEW BIRDS.
I'VE NOTICED THAT THE SKY TURNS A PALE GREEN BEFORE SUNSET.
IT'S ALSO GREEN IN THE MORNING, BUT BLUE DURING THE DAY.
THE PLANET IS MOSTLY MOUNTAINOUS, AND IT SEEMS THE ANIMAL LIFE STAYS
OUT OF THE MOUNTAINOUS REGION, PROBABLY BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF
PLANTLIFE.
FOUND A PLEASANT LITTLE VALLEY LAKE AT 319.51:66.-62
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF GRASSY ISLANDS OFF THE COAST AT 69.60:-11.-23

A COLD, BUT NOT FROZEN PLANET OF BLUE SKIES, THIN AIR, AND TREES OF
GOLDEN BROWN LEAVES. THE PLANET REMINDS ME OF FELYSIA IN LATE AUTUMN.
EXPLORING THE COAST AT 318.60:68.-50, I FOUND A VARIETY OF BUSHES AND
THREE SMALL GROVES OF TREES. THERE WERE ALSO SOME BIRDS.
THE PLANET'S OCEANS ARE PURPLE AND PINK, AN INTERESTING COLORATION.
ALSO NOTABLE ARE THE PLANET'S IMPRESSIVE RINGS WHICH CAN BE VIEWED
IN ALL THEIR GLORY BY CIRCLING THE PLANET IN FAR CHASE MODE.

DISCOVERED BY SHADOWSTAR ON 6011:850.529
DISCOVERED BY SHADOWSTAR ON 6011:850.529
USED THIS AS A KIND OF HOMEWORLD DURING MY EXPLORATION OF SURROUNDING
SPACE.
AT 173:031, I FOUND A HUGE WHITE CATLIKE CREATURE. IT MUST HAVE BEEN
TWICE MY SIZE AT LEAST. IT WASN'T AS FAST AS ME THOUGH. IT LOOKED AT
ME AND BOUNDED AWAY. I RAN AROUND IT A FEW TIMES BUT IT DID NOT
REACT. I THEN CAUGHT A SMALL BIRD. THE PLANET IS NOT AS LUSH AS
FELYSIA, AND HAS A STRANGE GREENISH ATMOSPHERE WITH LITTLE WATER.
THE SURFACE APPEARS TO BE LARGELY ROCKY, WITH LITTLE VEGETATION.
GRAVITY IS NEARLY EQUAL TO FELYSIA, WITH A NEARLY ARCTIC TEMPERATURE
EVEN AT THE EQUATOR.
AT 130:062, THE AREA IS FAIRLY FLAT WITH BRIGHT BLUE DIRT THROUGHOUT
THE REGION AND SMALL ANIMALS THAT ARE AS BLUE AS THE GROUND, ALLOWING
THEM TO BLEND IN QUITE WELL, AS THIER SMALL SIZE PUTS THEM BELOW MY
LEVEL OF VISION. HUNTING HERE IS DIFFICULT. AS USUAL, THE THICK,
VAPOROUS ATMOSPHERE GIVES THE SKY A SURREAL APPEARANCE EVERYWHERE.
AT 123:022, I FOUND ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE BIG WHITE CATS, BUT THIS ONE
WAS NOT QUITE AS BIG AS THE LAST ONE, STILL LARGER THAN ME.
ALSO SAW WHAT APPEARED TO BE HUGE SNOW HILLS IN THE DISTANCE. IT WAS
QUITE COLD THERE, WELL BELOW FREEZING. I THINK THESE CATS MAY BE
A KIND OF POLAR CAT, LIKE A POLAR BEAR, LARGE AND PREDATORY, ADAPTED
TO THE COLD CLIMATE. I HAVE NOT SEEN THEM IN THE WARMER REGIONS
WHERE THE TEMPERATURE CAN REACH ABOVE FREEZING.
AT 145:033, LANDED IN AN OCEAN WHICH WAS REMARKABLY HOT CONSIDERING
THAT THE REST OF THE PLANET WAS NEARLY ARCTIC. HERE, THE TEMPERATURE
WAS NEARLY 30C. ALSO THE WATER WAS BRIGHT ORANGE AND I WAS CAUGHT IN
A POWERFUL CURRENT FOR A FEW MOMENTS THAT CARRIED ME A FEW METRES
AWAY FROM MY POD WHILE SWIMMING BACK. FORTUNATELY, IT WAS SHORT
LIVED AND I WAS ABLE TO RETURN.
AT 243:059, FOUND AN AREA OF BLUE MOUNTAINS. THEY AREN'T AS BIG OR
SPECTACULAR AS ON SOME PLANETS, BUT THEY SEEM FAIRLY UNCOMMON ON THIS
PLANET, BEING MOSTLY LOW PLAINS AND SHALLOW HILLS.
AT 89:60, -3.82, I CAME ACROSS A SERIES OF SILVER LAKES, ALMOST
FROZEN FROM THE NEARLY 0C TEMPERATURE, REFLECTING THE GREEN SKY AND
THE DARK LANDSCAPE BELOW. VERY SURREAL.
AT 87.62, I LANDED IN THE MIDDLE OF WHAT I EXPECTED TO BE A RAINSTORM
BUT THERE WAS NO RAIN. THE LIGHTNING WAS FIERCE, HOWEVER. THIS
PLANET IS VERY DRY, EVIDENCED BY THE FACT THAT THE ONLY WATER ON THE
PLANET IS LOCKED AWAY IN TINY FROZEN POOLS AND BODIES OF WATER NO
LARGER THAN SMALL SEAS. THIS COULD ALSO ACCOUNT FOR THE LACK OF
VEGETATION. IT SEEMS THE LIFEFORMS ON THE PLANET ARE ENTIRELY ANIMAL
BASED AND CARNIVORES, FROM LARGE CATS AND HOPPERS TO TINY SCAVENGER
BIRDS. STILL, THERE MUST BE SOME VEGETATION SOMEWHERE. ONE WOULD
SURMISE IT NECESSARY TO SUPPORT ANY FORM OF ANIMAL LIFE.
FINALLY! I'VE FOUND WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR: PLANTS, BUT EVEN MORE,
I MAY HAVE DISCOVERED SOME KIND OF TERRAFORMING PROJECT.
AT 86,49, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PERFECTLY SQUARE AND RECTANGULAR
LAKES, AMIDST A VARIETY OF BUSHES, GRASS, AND MOSSY ROCKS. THE
ENVIRONMENT OF THIS AREA IS ENTIRELY DIFFERENT THAN THE REST OF THE
PLANET. THIS IS WHY I THINK IT MAY BE OR HAVE BEEN SOME KIND OF
TERRAFORMING PROJECT. ALSO, THE ARTIFICIAL LAKES IN THIS AREA APPEAR
TO HAVE CAUSED THE TEMPERATURE TO RISE TO FELYSIAN NORMS.
IN THE NEARBY SEA, AT 87.51, I FOUND A RAINSTORM, ALONG WITH WHAT
APPEARS TO BE AN AQUATIC FELINE. THE CREATURE WAS DARK GREY IN COLOR
AND SWAM UP TO MY POD AFTER I LANDED. IT SEEMED TO BE TRYING TO GET
INSIDE.SMALLER AND MORE NIMBLE THAN THE WHITE ARCTIC CATS FOUND
ELSEWHERE ON THE PLANET, THIS CREATURE SEEMED TO BE AT HOME IN THE
WATER, EVEN IN THE RAIN, AND WAS MORE CURIOUS ABOUT ME THAN THE OTHER
CREATURES.
NEXT TO THE TERRAFORMING PROJECT, I FOUND MORE, IN 87.49.
THERE ARE TREES HERE AS WELL, AND WHAT APPEAR TO BE BLACK CROWS THAT
FLY AROUND. I ALSO NOTICED ONE OF THE TREES HAD AN ODD BLUISH WEB
IN THE BRANCHES. THIS PLANET HAS BECOME TRULY FASCINATING.

I WAS TRULEY ASTONISHED UPON THE DISCOVERY OF THIS PLANET. IT IS A
FELISIAN PLANET, AND UNLIKE MIRACLE, IS WARM ENOUGH IN SOME AREAS TO
SUPPORT VARIED WILDLIFE AND VEGITATION. THAT BEING SAID, UNUSULA'S
WEATHER PATTERNS AND ECOSYTEMS ARE COMPLETELY BIZZARE. IN ONE QUADRANT
I DISCOVERED A WOODED AREA, COMPLETE WITH BIRDS AND THE OCCASIONAL
HOPPER. BUT THEN I TRAVELED ONE QUADRANT TO THE EAST, AND WAS
ASTONISHED TO DISCOVER A COMPLETELY BARREN, FROZEN WASTELAND
(-125 DEGREES CELCIUS).THIS IS A PLANET YOU MUST SEE FOR YOURSELF.

EERIE PLANET THAT APPEARS IN A DEEP-BLUE LIGHT FROM THE SURFACE
HENCE THE NAME (ZAG 6011.674.650)
A BEAUTIFUL AND RELAXING PLACE. LAND ON AN AREA WHERE THE TWIN SUNS
WILL BE VISIBLE. FRAMED BY THE PLANET'S ODD ROLLING HILLS, THEY CAN BE
A TRULY BEAUTIFUL SIGHT. THE PLANET'S SURFACE IS SILVERY GRAY, AND
CONSISTS OF VERY FLAT PLAINS SPECKLED WITH WHAT I BELIEVE ARE ICE
CRYSTALS, AS WELL AS HIGH, ELONGATED, SMOOTH HILLS THAT ARE FUN TO
CLIMB FOR SIGHT-SEEING. WORTH A LANDING, I BELIEVE.
-PARRY LOST, EPOC 6011.712.918
THIS THIRD MAJOR OBJECT OF THE RED SISTERS SYSTEM IS NOT
SO JUNIOR. IT IS A STAR THAT HAS A LARGE PLANETARY SYSTEM OF
ITS OWN, CONTAINING TWELVE DISTINCT WORLDS, SEVERAL OF THEM
WITH ATMOSPHERES, AND AT LEAST ONE OF THEM -- A GIANT FAILED
STAR. NOT ALL HAVE BEEN EXPLORED AS OF THIS DATE.
-PARRY LOST, 6011.712.923
FOURTH PLANET OF THE SYSTEM, SOLID, HAS A THIN ATMOSPHERE.
MAKES UP FOR A BORING, GREENISH-GRAY SURFACE WITH *RINGS.*
A RINGED SOLID PLANET!
RINGS DO NOT SEEM TO BE VISIBLE FROM THE SURFACE. THE TWIN SUNS ARE SEEN
AS TWO WEAK POINTS OF LIGHT. SURFACE IS BORING, FLAT, GREEN AND GREY, WIT
H OCCASIONAL CRYSTALS. I BELIEVE THE RING MIGHT BE THE REMAINS OF A THIRD
MOON THAT BROKE APART IN ANCIENT TIMES IN AN UNKNOWN CATACLYSM.

P.S. ALSO, YOU HAD TO TYPE 'CAT NOIR' TO READ THIS. HURAY FOR PUNS!
THIRD MOON OF THIRD MAJOR OBJECT IN THIS MULTIPLE SYSTEM.
DISCOVERED BY PARRY LOST 6011.712.921
A SMALL, ROCKY WORLD, APPEARS EMERALD GREEN FROM ORBIT. HAS ONE
MAJOR EQUATORIAL CRATER, AND TWO OTHER MAJOR CRATERS NEAR THE
SOUTH POLE. UPON LANDING, I DISCOVERED IT ACTUALLY HAS A THIN
ATMOSPHERE -- I GOT A READING OF 0.075 FOR PRESSURE. THE
SURFACE APPEARS BROWNISH-REDDISH-GREEN, IS COEVERED BY SMOOTHLY
ROLLING HILLS, AND EMBEDDED ICE CRYSTALS.

SIXTH MOON OF THIRD 'PLANET' (ACTUALLY A STAR IN THIS MULTIPLE

OBJECT. I BELIEVE IT IS A FAILED STAR. THE SURFACE IS ORANGEISH, AND
APPEARS TO HAVE NO BLEMISHES UPON IT AT ALL.

ELEVENTH MOON OF THIRD MAJOR OBJECT OF THIS SYSTEM. DISCOVERED BY
PARRY LOST ON 6011.712.922
SMALL, SOLID WORLD WITH VERY THIN ATMOSPHERE. FROM SPACE, HAS A
STRIKING DARK BLUE COLOUR INTERSPERSED WITH BLACK PATCHES. THERE IS
AN ICE CAP, I BELIEVE, ON THE SOUTH POLE. I ALSO SAW A BRIGHT SPOT
NEAR THE PLANET'S EQUATOR, BUT AM UNSURE OF HOW TO EXPLAIN IT --
PERHAPS A HIGH-ALTITUDE STORM. I SAW NOTHING UNUSUAL THERE UPON
LANDING. UP CLOSE, THE SURFACE IS BEAUTIFULLY DARK BLUE. THERE ARE
FAINT CLOUDS VISIBLE IN THE SKY, ESPECIALLY TOWARDS THE HORIZON,
WHERE DEFRACTION IS GREATER. THERE ARE SMOOTHLY ROLLING HILLS; I SA
NO OTHER FORMATIONS. -PARRY LOST, 6011.712.922
12TH, AND MOST REMOTE, MOON OF THE THIRD MAJOR OBJECT. DISCOVERED
BY PARRY LOST ON 6011.712.922
A VERY THICK ATMOSPHERE SURROUNDS THIS FAIRLY LARGE WORLD.
FROM SPACE THE WORLD LOOKS SILVERY-WHITE WITH LARGE BRIGHTER
SPOTS THAT MUST BE STORMS. UPON LANDING, THE SURFACE IS ALSO
WHITE, BUT STAINED WITH A MYRIAD SMALL BLACK SPLOTCHES. ON THE
DAY SIDE, THE LOCAL SUN IS STILL VISIBLE THROUGH THE THICK CLOUDS
-PARRY LOST, 6011.712.923
THIS MOON IS COVERED BY A STRANGE, TRANSLUCENT LAYER OF SOME ICY
SUBSTANCE. HILLS AND MOUNTAINS ARE TRANSPARENT, AND A SOLID PURPLE
SURFACE CAN BE SEEN FAR UNDER THEM. OTHER HILLS CAN BE SEEN THROUGH
THEM. I WALKED FAR FROM MY POD, OVER MANY HILLS, AND COULD STILL SEE IT
RIGHT THROUGH THEIR CURVATURE!
TRY LANDING AT 77.181, AND WALK TO 59.-47 TO FIND A LARGE, ALMOST
PERFECTLY CIRCULAR CRATER MADE OF THE SAME SUBSTANCE. THE EDGES ARE NOT
TOO STEEP, SO JUMP RIGHT IN. QUITE INTRIGUING! YOU CAN SEE REMOTE
MOUNTAINS RIGHT THROUGH THE CRATER'S WALLS.
I BELIEVE THE SUBSTANCE IS SOME SORT OF GAS FROZEN AT THE VERY LOW
TEMPERATURES OF THE MOON, PRESERVED IN ITS FRAGILE STATE BY ITS LOW
GRAVITY. TO FIND IT, GO TO THE RED SISTERS SYSTEM AND THEN THE FOURTH
PLANET. -PARRY LOST, EPOC 6011.712.918

FOR SD OR EVEN FACTORIES FOR BULDING THEM.
THESE CONSTRUCTIONS ARE SOMETIMES HIGHER THAN OTHERS,
PERHAPS THIS IS DUE TO SOIL PLACED ON THEM OVER THE AGES.
OTHER TIMES THEY ARE FOUND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SEA,
BUT THEN THOSE LOCATIONS MIGHT HAVE BEEN SUBMERGED AFTER THE PLACE WAS
ABANDONED. AS FOR THE TOWERS, WHAT COULD THEY BE FOR? OBSERVATION?

IL45'S ADDENDUM: THE COMPLEX AT 340:040 IS PROBABLY MUCH LARGER
THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT. THE STARBURST-SHAPED EMERALD SPYRE IS SUR-
ROUNDED BY A HUGE EMBANKMENT WALL. THIS WALL IS PROBABLY NOT NATURAL
AS IT IS MASSIVELY HUGE AND ROUGHLY SURROUNDS THE COMPLEX. CRACKS IN

ACCORDING TO THE NIV MANUAL, THIS SYSTEM WAS WHERE THE
STARDRIFTERS WERE MADE. ACCORDING TO THE NIII MANUAL, QUARTZ
PLANETS ARE USED TO BUILD STARDRIFTERS. ACCORDING TO COMMON
KNOWLEDGE, SOME QUARTZ PLANETS HAVE ARTIFICIAL PYRAMIDS. SINCE
THIS IS THE SYSTEM THAT CREATED STARDRIFTERS IN THE FIRST PLACE,
I'M GOING TO STRIP THIS PLANET DOWN UNTIL I FIND 2
PYRAMIDS, THUS SORT'VE PROOVING THAT THE PYRAMIDS ARE USED
SOMEHOW TO CREATE STARDRIFTERS.
SUCESS 1:I'VE FOUND A PYRAMID STRUCTURE AT 8:4. IT'S CLEARLY
ARTIFICIAL, THOUGH IT DOES BLEND IN WITH THE TERRAIN. NOW FOR
DISCOVERY 2....
ANOTHER PYRAMID AT 356:110! IT ISN'T AS PYRAMIDIAL AS I'D LIKE
IT, AND IT DOESN'T SEEM AS ARTIFICIAL AS SOME OTHERS I'VE SEEN,
BUT STILL.... I'LL GO LOOK FOR ONE MORE.
I ONLY FOUND A PYRAMID-ESQUE SHAPED OBJECT AT 8:65, AND LIKE THE
LAST ONE, THIS ONE CAN BE ARGUED TO BE NATURAL. NONETHELESS, THE

THIS OBJECT FORMEN INDEPENDENTLY AS A 'WANNA-BE' STAR (BROWN
DWARF?), AND THEN WAS CAPTURED BY THE ORANGE GIANT'S STRONG
GRAVITATIONAL FORCES WHEN PASSING BY. IF WE ASSUME THAT
BALASTRACKONASTREYA IS A TYPICAL MAIN SEQUENCE DWARF STAR, AND
THE MINIMAL MASS OF A STAR IS EIGHTY TIMES LESS THAN

HOWL VI IS A SUBSTELLAR PLANET AND IS NOT CONSISTANT
HOWL VI HAS 9 MOONS AND IS VERY BIG
HOWL VII DISCOVERED EPOC 6011 TRIADS 661.196.172
THE PLANET IS BROWN AND HAS NO ATMOSPHERE
THE PLANET HAS MANY CRATERS AND HAS 1 MOON
IT IS ALSO VERY UNSTABLE, SO LANDING IS IMPOSSIBLE
HOWL VIII DISCOVERED EPOC 6011 TRIADS 661.204.291. NO MOONS
HOWL VIII IS SMALL SIZED TAN PLANET WITH LOTS OF CRATERS
THE PLANET HAS NO ATMOSPHERE AND THUS CANNOT SUPPORT LIFE
THIS IS ALSO DUE TO THE COLD AND LOW GRAVITY
HOWL IX DISCOVERED EPOC 6011 TRIADS 661.204.525. IT HAS 2 MOONS
HOWL IX IS A VERY LARGE, YELLOW PLANET
IT HAS NO ATMOSPHERE AND IS NOT CONSISTANT

THE PLANET HAS BEAUTIFUL RINGS THOUGH
HOWL X DISCOVERED EPOC 6011 TRIADS 661.205.348
HOWL X IS THE FURTHEST PLANET AWAY, BUT NOT THE COLDEST
IT IS A MEDIUM SIZED, GREEN PLANET WITH THICK, PINK CLOUDS OVER IT
THE MOON IS GREEN AND HAS MANY CRATERS, WITHOUT LIFE
THE MOON IS COLD IS COLD AND HAS LOW GRAVITY
THERE WERE ICY SHARDS ALL OVER THE SURFACE WITH SOME HILLS TOO
HOWL VI M.1 DISCOVERED EPOC 6011 TRIADS 661.197.781
IT'S A MEDIUM SIZED MOON COMPLETELY SURROUNDED BY YELLOW CLOUDS
IT IS REASONABLY WARM, CONSIDERING THE DISTANCE FROM HOWL
THE GRAVITY IS JUS BELOW 1G AND THE AIRPRESSURE IS LOW
THE SURFACE SEEMS A BIT PURPLE WITH SOME STONES HERE AND THERE
HOWL VI M.2 DISCOVERED EPOC 6011 TRIADS 201.149
IT IS A MEDIUM SIZED MOON THAT IS FULLY COVERED BY CLOUDS
THE CLOUDS GLOW PINK, BECAUSE OF THE ANGLE THE SUN SHINES AT IT
ON THE SURFACE, IT IS SO DARK, I COULDN'T SEE A FOOT AWAY
THE MOON WAS A BIT RED THOUGH
WROTE DATE WRONG. REAL DATE IS EPOC 6011 TRIADS 661.201.149
HOWL VI M.3 DISCOVERED EPOC 6011 TRIADS 661.201.479
IT IS A SMALL SIZED MOON WITH BLUE CLOUDS AROUND IT
THE SURFACE HAD ALSO A BLUE COLOR
HOWL VI M.4 DISCOVERED EPOC 6011 TRIADS 661.201.994
IT IS A BLUE, GLOWING, MEDIUM SIZED MOON
IT HAS AN OXYGEN ATMOSPHERE AND HAS NO CLOUDS.
MOST OF THE MOON CONSISTS OF NATIVE QUARTZ
IT SEEMS THAT THE PLANET IS COVERED BY SEVERAL SPECIAL SPOTS
I CALL THEM: HOTSPOTS, DUE TO THEIR DARKRED COLOR
UPON CLOSER EXPECTION, I SAW THAT THERE WERE HUGE PILLARS THERE
A STRANGE THING INDEED
THE GRAVITY IS A BIT OVER 1G AND THE TEMPEREATUR IS 'NORMAL'
POST 4..12 ARE OF HOWL VI M.4
FOR THIS MOONS INFO, SEE HOWL VI M.3 POST 4 AND FOLLOWING
HOWL M.5 DISCOVERED EPOC 6011 TRIADS 661.202.854

IT HAS NO ATMOSPHERE, CANNOT SUSTAIN LIFE
HOWL IX M.2 DISCOVERED EPOC 6011 TRIADS 661.204.994
IT IS A SMALL SIZED, ICY MOON
IT HAS NO ATMOSPHERE
THE SURFACE IS COMPLETELY FLAT
THIS IS PROBABLY BECAUSE IT IS ALL ICE, THE ATMOSPHERE IS FROZEN
THE RAL GROUND BEGINS ABOUT 200 KM DEEP I THINK
THE GRAVITY IS ALSO REMARKABBLY HIGH, OVER 0,5G, FOR A SMALL MOON.
HOWL X M.1 DISCOVERED EPOC 6011 TRIADS 661.206.747
IT IS A MEDIUM SIZED, RED PLANET, WHICH IS INTERNALLY HOT
THE SURFACE IS UNSTABLE AND THUS I AM UNABLE TO LAND.

WHILE SWIMMING IN THE BODY OF WATER AT 205.59, I SAW WHAT SEEMED
TO BE TWO ROTATING LIGHTS, ONE FROM THE WEST AND ONE FROM THE
EAST. LIGHTHOUSES, PERHAPS?
SEARCHING FOR THE POSSIBLE WESTERN LIGHTHOUSE AT 200.60, I FOUND
MYSELF IN A LARGE MOUNTAIN RANGE. ALSO, I CONFIRMED THAT BOTH
AVIAN AND FELINE CREATURES EXIST HERE. GOING EAST TOWARDS THE
WATER AND SEVERAL SURPRISINGLY TALL AND STEEP SPIRES, I CAME
ACROSS MULTIPLE FELISIAN RUINS; OUR PEOPLE WERE DEFINITELY HERE.

EXPLORED THE CENTER OF ONE OF THE LARGE SPIRALS TODAY AT 261.61.
SPIRALS ARE DEFINITELY STORMS; I HAD TO CONTEND WITH LIGHTNING
AND RAIN. FOUND BOTH BIRDS AND SOME SORT OF JUMPING MAMMAL.
ALSO, ROUGHLY TO THE NORTH AND WEST OF THE POD, I FOUND A LARGE
FLAT AREA, COMPLETELY COVERED IN SOME HIGHLY REFLECTIVE MATERIAL
. UNSURE IF IT WAS ICE OR SOMETHING ELSE. RAN ACROSS IT WITH
LITTLE DIFFICULTY.

PLANET HAS BREATABLE ATOMSPHERE; HUGE OCEANS CAN BE SPOTTED FROM

HAS DIFFICULTY TO REACH UP WITH THIS SPEED.
SURFACE EXPLORAITON TO COMENCE ASAP.
NOW THIS IS A WORLD WORTH PROSPECTING! HUGE MOUTNAIN FOUND AT
000:060, BEATUTIFULL LANDSCAPE AROUND IT.
I HAVE A FEELING THERE MIGHT BE MORE, SO I AM GOING BACK DOWN
THERE TO TAKE A NEW LOOK.
FURTHER NOTES: THIS PLANET IS DEFINANTLY FELISIA FORMED. IT JUST
HAS TO BE. IT IS SO FAR AWAY FROM ITS STAR; BUT STILL; AVARAGE
SURFACE-TEMPERATURES IS +15 DEGREES C! PRESSURE IS 1.234 ATM,
GRAVITY IS 1.000 FG. THE WORLD FEELS ANCIENT, AS IF SOMEONE ELSE
THEN FELISIANS HAVE BEEN HERE. THE WORLD HAS POTENTIAL FOR RELICS
NO STRUCTRES OR RUINS HAS BEEN DETECTED AS OF YET; BUT WE ARE
STILL EXPLORING IT. FURTHER NOTES WILL COME AS THEY BECOME
AVAILABLE.
DUE TO ITS PROXIMITY TO ITS STAR; THERE IS NEVER SOMETHING AS
NIGHT ON THIS PLANET. WHEN ONE STAR GOES DOWN BEHIND THE HORIZON,
ANOTHER ONE RISES TO TAKE ITS PLACE. PLANET HAS A LOT OF PLANT
AND ANIMAL-LIFE. VERY GOOD PLANET FOR PHOTO-TAKING.
SUNSETS AND SUNRISES ARE QUITE SPECTACULAR ON THIS PLANET.
TWO STARS RISES ON THE SAME TIME, AND SETS ON THE SAME TIME.
BEATEFULL COLORS AID TO THE SPECTACULAR LIGHT-SHOW. A GOOD PHOTO
OPERTUNITY TO SAY THE LEAST...
CONCLUSION: GRADYRIA 3.2 IS A WORLD WORTH RE-VISITING.
I WIL NOW TAKE ONE LAST TOUR DOWN THERE, BEFORE HEADING BACK TO
THE JOUNREY.
THERE'S A GIGANTIC MOUNTAIN AT 54.44, WITH A BEAUTIFULL
LANDSCAPE AROUND IT. THE LANDSCAPE IS RED, MAKING IT LOOK LIKE
MARS. IT IS FILLED WITH LIFE IN ALL FORMS. A VISIT IS RECOMENDED.
CONCLUSION: THIS WORLD SHOULD DEFINENTLY BE RE-VISITED BY OTHER
DRIFTERS. THE MOUNTAIN FOUND DONT LOOK VERY NATURAL. THIS MIGHT
BE A LOST WORLD OF THE ANCIENTS, OF COURSE; IF THAT IS TRUE, THEN
THIS IS A DISCOVERY GREATER THEN STARGATE ITSELF! MORE INFO IS
REQUIRED, HOWEVER, BEFORE WE KNOW FOR SURE. WE ARE NOW LEAVING
THIS WORLD, TO SEARCH FOR OTHER ONES. INTERPLANETARY-PULSEDRIVE

GREAT DEUS! THATS NO PLANET. IT LOOKS ALIVE. A LITHIUM-EATER???
FINALLY I COUGHT UP WITH IT, ON MY FIFTH ATTEMPT. MY VIMANA IS

THIS IS THE FIRST FELISIAN WORLD I HAVE DICOVERED IN MY TRAVELS...

THIS PLANET IS TRULY REMARKABLE.
THE ENTIRE SURFACE SEEMS TO BE COMPOSED OF SOME SORT OF TRANSPARENT
CRYSTAL, WHILE UNDERNEATH MAY BE SOME THICKER, OPAQUE MATERIAL THAT GIVES
IT ITS GREENISH COLOR.
OBSERVING A SUNSET THROUGH ONE OF THIS WORLD'S MANY LARGE CRYSTAL

THIS IS A SMALL PLANET WITH A RATHER IMPRESSIVE SERIES OF THIN RINGS.
DISCOVERED BY SHADOWSTAR ON 6011:605.228
THIS IS A FASCINATING PLANET.
THIS WORLD APPEARS TO HAVE AN UNUSUAL WEATHER SYSTEM WHICH CAUSES
AN ABUNDANCE OF WEATHER AROUND THE EQUATOR OF THE PLANET. THIS COULD BE
RELATED TO THE FACT THAT THE POLAR ICE CAPS HAVE APPARENTLY MELTED,
COVERING THE SURFACE OF THE PLANET IN WATER.
DESPITE THIS, THE PLANETARY CLIMATE IS ACTUALLY QUITE COOL.
DISCOVERED INTERESTING AMPHIBIOUS ANIMALS WHICH BEAR A RESEMBLANCE TO A
RABBIT, WHICH SEEMS TO CONSTANTLY SWIM.
THIS COULD INDICATE THAT THE FLOODING OF THE PLANET WAS A RECENT
PHENOMENON, AND THE LIFEFORMS HAVE ADAPTED FROM LAND-BASED ANIMALS INTO
AN AMPHIBIOUS FORM.
ON ANOTHER EXPEDITION, I ENCOUNTERED LARGE, MESA-LIKE ISLANDS WITH
STEEP CLIFFS AND NO BEACHES OR SHORELINES. THIS SUPPORTS THE THEORY
THAT THE PLANET'S FLOODING WAS RECENT.
FUTHERMORE, IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE FLOODING WAS NOT A RESULT OF POLAR
ICE CAPS MELTING DUE TO PLANETARY HEAT, BASED ON THE PLANET'S DISTANCE
FROM ITS SUN. POSSIBLY UNNATURAL PHENOMENON?
MADE ANOTHER TRIP TO THE PLANET. LANDED IN THE STORMY EQUATORIAL REGION.
DURING LANDING, I SPOTTED SOMETHING WHICH APPEARED TO BE FLOATING ON THE
WATER IN THE FAR DISTANCE. I ATTEMPTED TO SWIM TO IT, BUT LOST TRACK OF
IT IN THE STORM. ON TAKEOFF, I WAS ABLE TO LOCATE THE OBJECT, BUT I
COULD SWEAR IT WAS MOVING UPWARD, AT NEARLY THE SAME SPEED AS MY LANDING
POD. IT DID NOT DEVIATE FROM ITS FLIGHT LIKE MOST AVIAN LIFEFORMS.
UNFORTUNATELY, I WAS UNABLE TO IDENTIFY THE OBJECT.
FROM MY POINT OF VIEW, IT APPEARED ONLY AS A SMALL SPECK OF LIGHT,
THOUGH IT WAS QUITE BRIGHT. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT WAS, BUT I HAVE
CONSIDERED THE POSSIBILITY THAT IT WAS A FELLOW EXPLORER'S LANDING POD.
BUT I SUPPOSE I WILL NEVER KNOW FOR SURE. THEN AGAIN, MAYBE I'VE BEEN
BEEN A BIT TOO CARELESS IN MY HUNTING OF LIFEFORMS. WILL HAVE TO MAKE A
MORE DETERMINED EFFORT TO AVOID POSSIBLE NARCOTIC FOOD SOURCES...
VISITED SOME OF THE LARGER ISLANDS TO THE NORTH.
FOUND A NICE HILLY AREA COVERED IN VARIOUS BRIGHT-RED FLORA.
THESE ISLANDS ARE SMOOTH AND COVERED IN ROLLING HILLS, WHICH IS
DIFFERENT FROM THE SMALLER, BROKEN, CLIFF-LIKE ISLANDS FOUND IN THE

WHILE EXPLORING THE SURFACE, I CLIMBED AN INCREDIBLY HIGH MOUNTAIN,
WHICH OVERLOOKED A LARGE VALLEY.
ON MY WAY DOWN THE MOUNTAIN HOWEVER, I SLIPPED AND FELL.

LANDED ON A MORE OR LESS HILLY SURFACE, AND OF COURSE, THE
PREREQUISITE HOPPER WAS THERE. AT 10.61 I SAW BIRDS. A CHANGE
OF VENUE TO 26.54:43.-38 PUT ME INTO WHAT I THOUGHT WAS WATER.
BUT IT WAS ICE. I SAW A PECULIAR, NON MOVING, BLOCK LIKE
OBJECT, BUT I DIDN'T INVESTIGATE BECAUSE I WAS BECOMING
DISORIENTED BY THE ENVIRONMENT. IN FACT, THAT'S A SALIENT PART
OF THIS WORLD, BECAUSE OF THE BLUE LIGHT FROM ITS STAR AND THE

POSSIBLY CRATERS. LANDING SITE WAS A SPOON SHAPE.
SURROUNDED BY MOUNTIANS AND VERY LARGE HILLS. MANY CRYSTELLIANE

RULED OUT AS THE TEMPURATURE AT THE LANDING SITE WAS APPROX.
+63 DEGREES. SENSORS INDICATE THAT THE CRYSTAL SUBSTANCE IS A

WELL, WELL. MY TRIP TO THE SURFACE WAS RATHER UNEVENTFUL.
WHEN I GOT DOWN THERE, IT WAS SO DARK, I THOUGHT I HAD
LANDED ON THE 'NIGHT' SIDE OF THE PLANET, SO TO SPEAK
TURNS, OUT, I WAS ON THE DAYLIGHT SIDE, IT WAS JUST REALLY
REALLY DARK ON THERE. AGAIN, THAT'S INTERESTING FOR A PLANET
WITH A VERY THIN ATMOSPHERE TO HAVE SUCH IMENSE COULD COVER.
LIKE HERBER'S SPOON, THERE ARE MANY LARGE HILLS AT THE
LANDING SITE, 336.55, AS WELL AS THE SANE QUARTZ LIKE

THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY NO SIGNS OF LIFE HERE. (HERBIE, 6011.597.693)
DESPITE ITS PROXIMITY TO THE SUN, THIS RINGED PLANET IS
SURPRISINGLY DARK, HENCE ITS NAME. THE THICK ATMOSPHERE DISTORTS
THE SUNLIGHT THAT GETS THROUGH, GIVING ITS SUN A MISSHAPEN
APPEARANCE. BE AWARE THAT IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO LOCATE YOUR POD,
SHOULD YOU WANDER AWAY FROM IT. (HERBIE, 6011.597.693)
UPON CLOSER INSPECTION, THE STAR APPEARS TO BE RINGED, RATHER THAN

FIRST PLANET OF MANY, GREEN GROUND.
RELATIVELY SMALL TERRAIN FEATURES RANGING FROM FLATS TO HARSH SPIKES.
STRANGE TRAVELLING ATMOSPHERIC DISTURBANCES, CAUSING PINK SPOTS
PINK SPOTS APPEAR TO CAUSE CERTAIN THINGS TO APPEAR
SUCH AS HUGE MOUNTAINS OF SIZE NOT NORMALLY FOUND HERE.
PINK SPOTS MOVE RELATIVELY FAST, ONCE THEY MOVE AWAY FROM A POINT
OF INTEREST, THE FEATURE SUCH AS THE MOUNTAIN, DISSAPEARS.
